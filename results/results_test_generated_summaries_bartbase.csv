"TIFU play fighting with my bf, vomiting, then having an asthma attack
Me and my bf were lounging around the house yesterday. We call Sundays ""slack Sundays"" because we both have demanding jobs and Sunday is the only day we really get to chill out and do whatever we want. So we were wrapped up in a sheet on the couch browsing Netflix, no plans, no obligations, snacking on a very healthy and nutritious bowl of candy.

 However, a few hours into our do nothing session, he decided he wanted to do something. He said we should go hiking since the weather is warm, dry, and there was a nice breeze outside. Tbf, we don't get many opportunities to go hiking because of the unpredictable weather here... but the feeling of the cool comfortable sheet burrito. In my comfortable pajamas. Half asleep on the comfortable couch. I was in maximum relaxation mode. In other words, I wasn't about to get up any time soon, and told him. When he tried to persuade me with kisses, I said he would have to fight me out of bed (well, couch.)

This is how it happened. Instead of negotiating like a normal couple when we disagree on things, we like to wrestle, which is what we did. He jumped up and tried to drag me off the couch, while I tried to reel him back in. When he started gaining the upper hand, I decided to make a surprise attack as a last resort and knock him off his feet. So I wrapped my arms around his hips and pulled him down with me. Hard.

.......... I often underestimate our size difference. We're both big, muscular guys; He just has more fat and is 4 inches taller than me. I thought it would be fine as long as I braced myself, and shifted his weight toward the other side of the couch instead of my body.

I was given a very rude reality check.

I was strong enough to tug him down, but definitely not enough to shift his weight. Before he collapsed, he flipped over and ended up landing ass-first on my gut. A couple things happened very quickly: I felt all the wind being knocked out of my lungs and couldn't catch my breath. Then, I started feeling extremely nauseous. All the candy I ate, combined with the jostling from play fighting, and now his butt was grinding into my gut. Awful combination. Before I could shove him off of me, I felt the bile coming up and grabbed the closest vomit receptacle, which was the candy bowl that unfortunately was still half full. And just in time. I've never vomited so much in my life.

Bf immediately wiggled off me and stared at me, understandably shocked. Around the third round of puking, he ran to the kitchen to grab some napkins and I was mostly dry heaving at that point... Which made it difficult to breathe. Then I started wheezing, my airway felt damp, and I could feel my asthma flaring up. I stopped puking just long enough to croak out that I need my inhaler. He thankfully heard me and ran around to the usual places looking for my inhaler, but yelled that he couldn't find it, so he brought my nebulizer and Montelukast pouches instead.

When I finally stopped emptying my stomach, he wiped my mouth and snapped the mask over my face, and I got some some sweet, sweet oxygen back in my lungs. Don't remember much after that because the meds made me feel woozy.

Needless to say; We didn't go hiking, and we're going to be much more careful wrestling from now on.",I pulled my giant boyfriend on top of me while we were play fighting and vomited after his ass jabbed me in the gut. Started wheezing because my asthma got triggered. Had to use my emergency nebulizer to avoid an asthma attack.,"Played with my bf, got him to fight me out of bed, then had an asthma attack."
"TIFU by thinking I still possessed youthful agility
On my run this morning, I came across a saw horse that has been on my route for a little over a week now.   Every other time I’ve gone running, I’ve just run around it. This time, however, I was feeling good and wanted to jump it.  As someone who ran the hurdles in high school, I felt confident that I would be able to do so. 

I was not. Evidently my muscles and tendons are not as springy as they were when I was 18 and I caught my back foot as I was going over it. This caused me to stumble and ultimately face plant into a nearby lamppost. 

Now, I’m sitting here with ice over a golf ball that’s growing over my eye and I have an important work presentation in 24 hours. Not my finest moment. 

For those wondering, this is my eye: https://imgur.com/a/30ldSqa",I thought I was still physically capable of hurdling things and now I get to give a presentation with a black eye.,I fell off a saw horse and faceplanted into a lamppost.
"TIFU by drinking a smoothie with a coworker
So, this didn't happen today, it happened on Friday, just realized this is right up this subs alley.

So, on Friday, I was decided to hang with a new coworker for the first time after work while our boyfriends were working/busy. We both wanted some food but not something huge so we stopped by a smoothie place. We both got a smoothie with dragon fruit, strawberries, raspberries, mango and mango juice. Everything is going well as we walk the few blocks to his place and get settled in to chat and play some games. I realize I haven't eaten anything in awhile and Im feeling a bit shaky, so I drink a normal amount of gulps from my smoothie, not even a tenth of it, MAYBE 10 gulps. 

I feel it hit my stomach immediately like a rock. I assume it's just my anxiety and/or the caffeine and not eating in awhile, so I just drink some water and chill. Within minutes though, I'm burning up and I feel like I'm going to puke. My anxiety kicks up even more and I ask for a wet paper towel to help me cool off. That does absolutely nothing, and so within another 5 minutes, I'm running to the bathroom and puking up everything I just drank. Afterwards, I can't talk, my throat is absolute raw mess, and I'm realizing that I've bene having increasingly weird reactions to berries over the last 8 months. 

I'm freaking out, my coworker is freaking out, I take a benadryl, call my partner and then end up calling 911 to make sure that I wasn't going into anaphylaxis. They cleared me but now I can't eat any fruits, especially berries until I can get testing done, just in case. I went to the store yesterday and I almost cried because I couldn't get some of my favorite foods for cross contamination concerns. Annnnnd, I managed to have to call 911 on the first time hanging with a new friend.","I drank a smoothie and found out Im allergic, causing me to have to call 911 and now avoid all fruits and berries until further notice.",Drank a smoothie with a new coworker for the first time and felt like I was going to puke.
"TIFU by accidentally trauma-bonding with my boss’s dog and now he follows me home
So my boss brought his dog to the office. Cute golden retriever named Max.  
Everyone was petting him, giving him treats, whatever. I stayed chill. I don’t trust dogs that trust everyone.

Then lunchtime hit. I was having a rough day.  
I sat in the break room alone, eating sad pasta and listening to *Landslide* by Fleetwood Mac.

Max walks in. Looks at me.  
Lays his head on my lap like he knows  
I start talking to him. Not baby talk  like full-on “life’s hard bro, huh?” type beat.  
He *sighs*.

For 20 minutes we just sit there in mutual emotional exhaustion.  
I think I cried a little.

Anyway. Now he follows me around the office. Growls at HR. Tries to get in my car when I leave.  
Today he brought me his leash.

My boss is annoyed.  
His wife says Max sleeps near the door now and “seems distant.”

I think I emotionally hijacked their family dog.

Do I return him? Or is this joint custody now?","Had a sad moment in the break room, boss’s dog comforted me, and now he emotionally imprinted on me. Dog might be mine now.",I accidentally kidnapped my boss's dog and now he follows me home.
"TIFU by being way louder than I thought during intimate times
My partner and I are students and still live with our parents. We try to do the deed when no one is at home, but that's not always possible and, well, sometimes the mood strikes with a bad timing. You know how it is, we try to be as quiet as possible, put on some white noise etc. Partner assured me the walls were soundproof and that neither their parents or sister ever mentioned they had heard anything. Well, we happened to have the house to ourselves one day and decide to test it out. Put on some white noise, and one of us moans softly in the room while the other listens from elsewhere in the house. 

Oh God do we hear everything, from any point in the house, as clearly as if standing in the room. I'm gonna go bury myself in the dirt now.",the walls were not soundproof,"My partner and I are students and still live with our parents. We try to do the deed when no one is at home, but sometimes the mood strikes with a bad timing."
"TIFU by flushing boiled eggs residue.
20M student and I boil eggs in a kettle. One egg burst inside, and to avoid clogging the sink, I rinsed the kettle and flushed the water into the commode. Later, my roommate went to the bathroom and came back looking awkward. Curious, I checked and saw egg residue had resurfaced it legit looked like someone had j*rked off in there. I panicked, flushed again, and we've never spoken about it since. It’s been pure silence between us ever since the Egg Incident. I still don’t know if he believes the truth or thinks I’m some kind of degenerate. Honestly considering retiring the egg kettle now, but the damage is already done.","Egg exploded in kettle, I flushed it down the toilet, residue made it look like something else happened. Roommate probably thinks I’m nasty.",Roommate thinks I'm some kind of degenerate.
"TIFU by reading a YA novel which is making me rethink my life
(using my burner account just cuz I'm embarrassed and don't want friends to be concerned about me)

Sorry in advance that this isn't the most interesting or crazy thing, but I really want to put this somewhere and I truly feel that I fucked up with this.

I'm a big fan of Dropout, so when I was at the library and saw a graphic novel by Brennan Lee Mulligan, I figured I would give it a read. It was evidently a YA novel. so I didn't think any of themes would be too intense. I was completely wrong.

I read the first two chapters just fine, but then I got to chapter three. It has a plot and a theme that is, far and away, one of my biggest paranoid fears which triggers me every time I see it. I'd describe it here but just thinking about it has me feeling sick and anxious while writing this.

I also made the big mistake of reading this immediately before bed. I was incredibly tired, and when I started sobbing, I couldn't stop. I physically couldn't stop thinking about what happened in the novel, seeing it every time I tried to close my eyes, and my thoughts started racing to all my other anxieties on top of that.

I'm 20, can't drive, live with my parents, don't have a job, and have dealt with suicidal ideation a lot in the past while never telling anybody because I'm scared of being sent away or forced to take pills. Every part of that list and more began swirling through my head, and I had the worst sobbing fit of my entire life so far. Eventually I had to get my parents because I didn't feel safe or like I was a real person.

It's the morning now, and I still can't stop thinking about it. I think I need to make some serious changes to my life, and as I talked about with my mom last night, I'm going to try to talk with my therapist about talking to a psychiatrist and being prescribed anxiety meds. I'm not sure how to feel normal again right now, so I'm going to try talking with my online friends and hopefully find distractions from the uptick in suicidal thoughts (For anyone worrying, I've never actually felt a desire to physically do it, it's just a struggle where I can't stop thinking about it sometimes)",I fucked up by reading a YA graphic novel which triggered me so badly that I'm finally making moves to get on anxiety meds and need to take a few days to distract myself from overwhelming thoughts.,"I read a YA novel which triggers my biggest fears, and I can't stop thinking about it.

"TIFU by getting the most drunk I have ever been in front of my coworkers
My (24F) company had an overnight meeting at a hotel. We had a dinner with an open bar and then an “after party” where the CEO had a tab for us. I was definitely drunk when she and the other higher ups were there, but this i remember and was not doing anything bad. And I was also told I was completely on par with the drunkenness everyone else was. When she left, I remember ordering my own drink (off her tab) and that is it. My coworker said he believes it was really the one that did me in. I woke up in my bed and honestly felt like nothing of note happened. I’ve never blacked out and then stayed awake for 3+ hours. 

I was late to our morning meeting, which was barely noticed. My CEO wished me a safe drive back and everything was fine. Two of my coworkers asked how was i feeling and one made a joke that I got the most sleep out of any of them. On my drive back, a coworker of mine called me how and asked how much i remember. I said after 10? Nothing. I assumed I had just went back and slept. That was NOT the case. I was a wreck. I cried, I talked about family issues, i talked to my ex boyfriend otp in front of them when he called me, called him my boyfriend on the phone, I tried to kiss the coworker that called me on my way home from the meeting multiple times (I am very very lucky he was amused by this. I am a small girl and he is quite a large man that said he would have probably went for it if I wasn’t incoherent. And added the next time k wanna try and kiss him, just be a couple drinks less drunk. But i understand this is at the very least sexual harassment and just because he is not angry doesn’t make it ok. I also have NO idea why i did that? I am not attracted to him in that way, my best guess is talking to my ex made me lonely and I wanted attention? ), I fell many times. Eventually the coworker I tried to kiss got me in my bed and I threw up on my bed, the floor, myself. I was alone when I did this

If you thought “man this couldn’t get any worse” you are WRONG. I then, with vomit on my shirt left my room without my room key and walked to another coworkers room where the people around their late 20s were. (Plus 2 men in their late 30s) I stayed for like 15-20 minutes where everyone could see the vomit on the top 1/5 of my shirt, and then was helped back to my room and called security because I didn’t have a room key. Then housekeeping was called and they cleaned up my room. One of the girls tipped housekeeping (which I asked for her Venmo and immediately sent it to her plus an extra $50 for her trouble). 

I am truly so mortified, I’ve never experienced anything like this. I’ve browned out for hours before, I’ve forgotten how I got home, but I’ve never had a true lapse in memory like this. And the brownouts happened few and far between in college (and were usually planned) ive never not been able to control myself to the point where I threw up somewhere i shouldn’t. Or to the point where I honestly just turned into a completely different person. Or even just to behave in a way that I absolutely am ashamed of. It’s safe to say I will never drink around my coworkers again. I am very socially anxious and I don’t really talk to any one at work. So I think the open bar + anxiety just made me not feel my drinks until it was too late. The coworker that called me was very very kind and they also made it clear to me that everyone in the room immediately agreed to keep it between them and that it was obvious I made a mistake but they would be keeping it between them. That they all have agreed “we’ve all been there”. they were all just worried when I skipped breakfast that I would skip the meeting. And that I should not worry about them spreading it around or telling our boss. And that they all know how horrible I must feel and do not want to add that. From what I can tell, everyone obviously wasn’t pleased (nobody said that but I mean I’m not an idiot) but that they all kind of are choosing to call it a mistake and move on. This is all coming from 2 coworkers but there were I believe 9 total that saw the worst of it. Idk how much I can trust that everyone is just going to forget about it, or If that was just those 2s personal feelings and if everyone else hates me. (When I expressed everyone must hate me, they also said no one hates you or even had a reason to hate you) 

If this happened with people I was close with, I’d feel much better. They know me and know this is unlike me. But these ppl will know me as “that girl”. Bc tbis was the first time in the 2 years I’ve worked there that I’ve ever been in a social setting with them. I’m worried the hotel told my boss or that the company has been banned from the hotel. I keep trying to think myself when I see people in that position and I usually just feel a strong sense of pity and wanting to help. So I am hoping that these people feel the same. I’m not really sure what I’m hoping for people to say, but i have been non stop thinking about this. And any words of comfort or just telling me what to expect or do, or maybe if you think the hotel would have banned the company or informed my boss would be really appreciated.","I got absolutely black out drunk for the first time at an out of state work event. No bosses or higher ups saw my treachery. A rundown of things I did: over shared, cried, tried to kiss my coworker multiple times, threw up on myself hotel room floor and myself, walked into the room the 9 coworkers that stayed after the boss left with vomit on my shirt, was helped back, security was called because I didn’t have my key, housekeeping was called to clean my room. Next day reactions: polite smiles which is standard, few ppl asked how I was feeling (atp I had no idea what I did), one girl joked I probably got the most sleep out of all of them, the boy I tried to kiss called me and told me everything, he was a good sport and told me nobody was angry w me and they were not telling management/HR.","Got drunk, talked to my ex boyfriend otp in front of my coworkers, threw up on my bed, floor, myself."
"TIFU. I explained biology to a friend, possibly ruining her love life.
Basically a while ago I was in an online discussion and the subject of k\*nk came up, and someone mentioned something called ""male squ\*rting."" I was a bit confused, but I wasn't gonna call them out on it. It's online strangers being wrong, I'm not gonna yuck anyone's yum, because who cares, right? but still it was in the back of my mind. Whatever, no biggie.

Today I was talking to a IRL friend, and we were both a little drunk, and we got to the subject of terrible sexual experiences of the past, and I was like ""Okay so here's a weird thing - did you know that there are people who are into something called ""male squ\*rting""? How weird is that?"" And she gets a little embarrassed, and I ask her what's up and she admits to me that her partner is really into that.

Me: ""Oh... okay then"" (clearly uncomfortable)  
Her: ""What? What's wrong?""  
Me: ""No, it's nothing. If you're into it that's great. No judgment.""  
Her: ""Look you clearly got something to say, so go ahead.""  
Me: ""I don't want to, because you might get grossed out and I don't want to ruin anything for you.""  
Her: ""You won't ruin anything, just say it.""  
Me: ""So you know it's just urine, right?""  
Her (clearly horrified): ""What?! No it isn't! Shut up! It's a different thing!""  
Me: ""I mean sure, you get it out differently I suppose, but it's still just urine.""  
Her: ""No it isn't! It's like female squ\*rting!""  
Me: ""you know that's just urine too, right?""  
Her: ""No it isn't! I googled it! Says it's a fluid that contains creatinine and urea""  
Me: ""Okay now google what urine contains.""

She was absolutely horrified and disgusted. Conversation got really really awkward after that, but it turns out her partner basically either lied to her or was unaware of it himself, but he convinced her to let him do it. She said goodbye soon after, and honestly I'm not sure how the hell am I even going to interact with her after this, and how am I supposed to interact with *him*. It just feels so awkward now.","- I explained to my friend that squ\*rting is just urine, and turned out she and her partner were into it, and she wasn't aware of what it was.

"TIFU by trying to get bigger…
Okay so I ain’t the most confident guy in the work when it comes to body image. Penis size.

I heard about penis enlargement and I saw that it’s actually possible to increase length and girth. Okay. I thought “I have to take the first step and start as soon as possible”.

Then I finally took initiative to start the process. Felt proud for managing to search and buy. I got myself a stretcher and a pump online. What I didn’t expect: the sellers would put the fucking label on the package.

The stretcher got here with label “toys… for adult entertainment” (very suggestive in my country). My sister signed it cause I wasn’t at home. Pretty sure she read that label and wondered what I had inside that box.

One week later, today, the pump arrives. My mom  got the package. I don’t think she tends to read labels, to be completely honest, but there is a chance she did, and that one was even worse.

“Automatic pump for penis with LCD penis exten-“ (it cuts, thank god, but not like you can’t find out if you think enough).

I am just that type of guy who’s pretty chill. I felt like my whole life was just exposed. Not sure what I expect posting that shit here but I genuinely wish I could dig a fucking hole and dive deep into it. The seal was almost broke, I could see that someone tried to see through the external package to check what’s inside - no clue if that was the mail guy or my mom, and I honestly don’t know what’s worse.

Pretty sure I’ll be anxious, paranoid and probably (much) more insecure for a while.","bought a pump and a stretcher to increase the size of my pp, but mom and sister probably read the package labels and I feel like dying now 💀",I got a pump and a stretcher for my penis and my mom got it.
"TIFU by tinkering with a running System for aesthetics alone
So, I recently built a new PC. 7800x3D, 4080S, high grade components all chosen with aesthetics in mind. If I spend 3 grand on a PC, might as well make it look good. But my mind goblin wasn't happy with the RAM, it wasn't quite fitting the vibe of the rest of my components. So, instead of replacing the kit, since I got it heavily discounted, I ordered aftermarket heat spreaders to exchange them with the original ones.

When they arrived today, I immediately went to work. I started prying the heat spreader of the first module. I should say, that the heat spreaders are glued to the memory modules. At some point, I thought that the way I was bending the PCB to pry it off can't be good, and something might give that shouldn't. So I continued more carefully.

For the second stick, I didn't even pry, I inserted a plastic separation tool at the edge, slowly cutting the glue between the memory modules and the heat spreader. When I was done I installed the aftermarket ones. (they don't use glue, but thermal pads and a few screws)

Aesthetic, on point! But the system... wouldn't boot. I thought about the flex of the first memory stick. I pulled it out, to see if it would boot just with the second one, that I was more careful with... but no, again just the DRAM debug light.

I swapped the sticks.. Boom, boot. No issue.. That didn't make any sense? I had been cautious with the second one, there was no flex... so why does the first one boot, and the second one doesn't?

It took me some more trial and error, but with my second visual inspection of the memory stick, I found it... a memory module had cracked, just at the edge, where I started to push the plastic separator in between the modules and the heat spreader.

I fucked up by tinkering with my running system, and by getting scared about bending it too much, and not allowing myself to bend it at all on the second one. As evidenced by the first one working, that much flex was ok. And at least a little was necessary to not crack a module when pushing in the separator.

really fast way to flush 100€ down the drain. Time to buy ram that fits my aesthetic better and not get lured by a discount. Not doing that again. q.q",I got RAM heat spreaders to exchange on a RAM kit I recently bought just for aesthetics for my new PC.

"TIFU By finding my bfs secret Reddit (Update)
So this is kinda of an update post about a TIFU i posted earlier today and deleted.

To summarize I F(27) fucked up by opening my bfs M (26) Reddit. We were hanging out at our friend’s place and he asked me to check if a friend had responded to a message. 

We have been together for 4 years now, living together for 3, we both wfh so we quite literally see each other everyday, know everything about each other and have no restrictions on seeing each others phones.

After checking the message I got onto his TikTok and got bored so switched over to Reddit where he generally has good memes.

Instead I was greeted with a Reddit account containing a lot of raunchy porn (Lots of Of threads and girls that actually kinda look like me). I was kind of flabbergasted and started laughing when he asked what’s up.

I’m not in the habit of lying so I tried telling him we could discuss it later (because our friend was there) he insisted a couple of times so I just blurted out, I saw your Reddit and showed him.

Here is where I may have Fucked Up: he immediately went defensive and started saying it wasn’t his, he doesn’t remember having that and switched over to his regular account. I immediately went into Don’t BS Me I’m not stupid mode, and instead of changing topic, pushed back against him “No this is clearly all stuff you like and you even commented on this post about the area we live in, not long ago” he KEPT pushing back a couple of times and I started reading the communities he was in out loud (which had not so lovely names) saying “This is clearly what your into, stop lying it’s ok” and laughing.

Our friend was very chill, he laughed and made the best of it, not making it awkward. I made a Reddit post about it because I felt a bit insecure about it in the moment. And I was reassured (thanks).

This is where the update part comes in:
We went and had an entire day with our friends and got home not so long ago, he sat down and told me: 

“I lied about it not being mine, I felt deeply embarrassed and terrible and didn’t want our friend to know that about me, I don’t think I’ll be able to see him in a while without feeling shame, I also felt embarrassed by you finding it, so I deleted all of it, after that I realized I, that was it, I have nothing for myself and you and I share absolutely everything, I don’t have a space that is only mine, (we live in a small apartment) we work together side by side, we have friends together, everything we do is together, nothing is just mine. And I realized I don’t want that. I don’t want to break up, I love you, but I don’t want that for me.”

And went to the gym. 

I honestly don’t know what to say or do, I think he’s right? It’s kinda sad that I accidentally stumbled upon that and destroyed his last bit of privacy. Any thoughts?",TIFU by uncovering my bfs secret Reddit account and exposing him to our friend and destroying his last bit of privacy,I opened my bfs M (26) Reddit and found a lot of porn on there.

TIFU for not drinking enough water for years,"I thought I was just unhealthy, but I was severely dehydrated. 

I wouldn’t start drinking water until after my energy drink, around 1pm. Some days, I would forget to drink water altogether. I had never really recognized thirst, except during intense drinking exercise or hot weather. Nobody in my immediate family drinks water. They drink tea or soda or alcohol, but no straight-up water. So, I thought I was fine, I was the most hydrated person I knew, after all. I’m also bulimic—purging, laxatives, exercise, restriction, the whole nine yards, which fucked me over so much worse. I always had health issues, especially with my heart, but I chalked it up to bulimia.

A few months ago, I went in for a strep test. The nurse was getting my vitals. They wanted a urine sample for a pregnancy test to see which antibiotics to prescribe, but I couldn’t provide one after 3 bottles of water. My heart rate literally went from 40 to 140 in seconds WHILE I WAS SEATED. They did my orthostatic vitals (laying, sitting, standing) and it was clear that I was dehydrated. I had to be rolled out in a wheelchair to go to the ER to get an IV. I felt much better after the IV, but I figured it was the pain meds they gave me for strep. 

More recently, I returned for my check up. They took my vitals again, had to do orthostatic, and gave me another IV. I felt amazing afterwards. I couldn’t remember ever feeling that alert and energized. I didn’t know you weren’t supposed to feel your heartbeat all of the time. I didn’t have any afterimages, and I wasn’t seeing faint stars in my vision. The strangest part was, I didn’t feel anything when I was sitting down or standing up. I couldn’t remember ever feeling so normal.

So, I made hydration a priority. I stocked up on HydraLyte, cut back on caffeine, am receiving treatment for bulimia, and set reminders to drink water. No more dry eyes or skin, better BMs, and I have a lot more color in my face. I can’t believe I lived like that for so long, especially with the fatigue and brain fog. I really hope it doesn’t have any long-term consequences. I wish I had known so much earlier!!!",Drink enough water.
"TIFU by not wearing sunscreen and getting a rare nerve reaction called “hell’s itch” and having the worst 30 hours of my life.
First off before anyone reads my story, i just want to say, Hells itch is NOT a normal sunburn itch. It’s some sort of nerve reaction. For those who think i am exaggerating how debilitating this is, please go over to r/HellsItch and read some user testimonials. Heres one from two days ago:


> “I've experienced acute heroin withdrawal with no medication (cold turkey), as well as a kidney stone that was too big to treat ultrasonically, Those were like a stubbed toe compared to this”




Anyway heres the TIFU. Several years ago i went to the beach for a few hours and like an idiot didn’t put sunscreen on.
I ended up getting a sunburn on my upper body. 

The next evening i was chilling on the couch watching tv after taking a shower when i suddenly felt a slight tickle on my chest. Not really thinking much of it i just brushed my hand across my chest thinking it was a hair or something. About a minute later the feeling came back suddenly and sharply, this time though it was more tingly and itchy.


I scratched the itch, thinking it’s just the sunburn itching and it went away. Probably about 10 seconds later it came back fiercely. The tingly itch was so strong my hand literally automatically jolted up to my chest to scratch it, like my brain forced it too. I was like huh? 


This didn’t feel like a normal sunburn itch, It felt deep in my skin. Have you ever got a random itch on the bottom of your foot or palm of your hand that feels like its a inch under your skin and you cant seem to scratch it? Thats what it felt like. I examined myself with a flashlight thinking a bug or something bit me, but nothing was there.


Within then next few minutes this tiny spot on my chest had started spreading to my entire chest and shoulders. It would itch FIERCELY and felt like ants with razorblades as feet were under my skin. At this point i started to panic and went to go put some aloe on it hoping to sooth it. BIG FUCKING MISTAKE. This amplified the itch twofold and significantly increased the pain. i was on the verge of tears. None of this made any sense. Aloe is supposed to help sunburns and sooth them.


By this time it had been maybe ten minutes since this started and little did i know a journey to the depths of hell was just beginning. I frantically started googling things like “extremely itchy sun burn how to relieve” and quickly discovered something called “Hell’s itch” or “suicide itch”. 


I did some reading and found out that this is not a typical sunburn itch it is something completely different and SIGNIFICANTLY worse. It occurs about 48 hours after a sunburn and the itch usually begins after taking a shower. Things that typically help relieve symptoms of a sunburn such as aloe or cream do the polar opposite and make the symptoms much worse, while things that normally make a sunburn hurt WORSE such as a hot shower HELP relieve the itch.



So here i was, standing in a BOILING hot shower, and it was helping. Once the hot water ran out i got out and started absolutely tweaking. The itch was so fucking bad that my brain literally forced my arms to reach up to scratch it, it was uncontrollably at this point and i was just pacing around tweaking out and itching. I could barely stand it was so bad.


This went on all night and all next day until the following morning. i didn’t sleep at all. I had to camp out on the couch so i wouldn’t keep my fiance up all night too because i literally could not sit still and was just crying and itching from the pain. It was so bad that i would rather relive breaking both of my legs during an accident i had as a teenager then deal with this hell on earth ever again.","Got a rare reaction to sunburn that caused a painful uncontrollable itching sensation that incapacitated me, it was so bad that it felt like molten lava fire ants under my skin for almost two days. Aloe vera and itching cream amplified the symptoms.",Don’t wear sunscreen. It’ll make your skin itch even worse.
"TIFU by getting my own insurance
I've been on my parents insurance since I was 16, now 20. It was going fine, they paid for it and I put my money towards my car. Today, my car is paid off and I have no tickets, no accidents, and tag is always up to date. We'll, recently (two days ago) my parents insurance needed to be renewed, and this year/month I needed to pay $200, I was appalled and told them to take me off their insurance because if 5 people needed to pay $200 each than the insurance was too expensive (for 5 cars it wasnt).

Well, I've been looking for insurance ever since, the lowest rate I could find was $475, my car is 10 years old, it's paid off, and I live 10mins from the city in the middle of know where! What the heck! I checked the quotes from every auto insurer there was. From Progressive to All State, from the Gecko to the General. All of them was at or above $300 a month, but don't worry! If I give them $1600 twice a year then it's technically a discount :D forget that rent in my area is $1200 plus utilities, forget that most homes in my area are around $200,000 so a mortgage with home owners insurance would be cheaper! Just don't think! Because you have to pay it!

And guess what? Because my parents took me off their plan their rates went down, and if they add me their rates would go up higher than it was before :D! FML",I have to pay $400+ a month for auto insurance because I was ignorant about the reality of the world,my parents took me off their insurance because it was too expensive.
"TIFU by accidentally ripping a CPU out of it's socket
By TIFU, I mean closer to 20 years ago.

I was the family/friend tech guy who built and worked on their computers.  I remember when a few years after I built my step-nephew's (same age) first custom desktop, it needed Windows reinstalled.  I did so, and at the same time, I re-arranged all the wiring to make it all nice and neat in the case.

He then wanted any fans that didn't already, to have blue LEDs, among them the CPU cooler - which, for whatever reason, wasn't able to simply have the existing cooler's fan replaced (maybe it was a weird size).  We went to Micro Center, picked up what we need, but on the way to the checkout, he sees a nice transparent (and semi-static) case, and it's cheap.  He's got to have it.

So I undid all the work I had done in his old desktop case, worked with him to rebuild the computer in the new case, which sucked, went to change the CPU cooler, but I didn't let the CPU warm up enough by leaving the computer on for a little while, and we ripped the CPU (with the socket still attached) out of its socket.  It would've been AMD 754-pin ""Socket 754"".  It sounded terrible when it came out.

The desktop no longer worked once we re-inserted the CPU onto the motherboard with its new blue LED cooler fan attached, so I found a newer, reasonably priced motherboard for him to buy that was still compatible with his now old CPU and RAM.

By the way, I'm more of a function over form kind of guy myself, I care about how my computer works, not how it looks other than keeping dust out.","- Rebuilt step-nephew's desktop, didn't discourage them from making more work for us both by buying unnecessary computer components, ended up doing even much more than we thought we would.",TIFU by accidentally ripping a CPU out of its socket.
"TIFU By Renaming someone’s dog
Today I fucked up by renaming somebody’s dog. So I was at a celebration of life and a few family members I had never met were there. These people brought their dog, I didn’t know whose dog he was. I was swimming as the celebration of life was at a lake, and the dog comes up to me. He didn’t have a name on his collar, so I looked at him and decided he looked like a Paulo (pow-lo), so I started calling him Paulo. I did this for the three day celebration until one of the owners saw what I was doing and asked why I was calling him Paulo. I said no one told me his name and he looks like a Paulo. They then told me his name was Benjamin. I said sorry he had been listening to Paulo so I just went with it. They asked what I meant so I walked away and called for him using Paulo, he ran right over and sat down. They then tried to call him using Benjamin, he didn’t move. They tried again, nothing. Twice more they tried nothing. Then they said Paulo and he ran right over. They gave him a middle name of Paulo that day. I’ll probably never see them again but I’ll forever know their dog is now Benjamin Paulo because of me.

Mini Update: I was just informed he was a rescue and they changed his name to Benjamin when they got him. Maybe his name was Paulo all along","At a celebration of life there was a dog I didn’t know, couldn’t find his name called him Paulo.

"TIFU getting drunk and puking inside my backpack
Oh boy… Welcoming party when I started college and teenage me goes drinking with the intention of getting wasted like never before. I drank sooooo much that at the end I was seeing double and my newly made friends had to drag-walk me to the metro station. 

We got into the train and took out places trying to keep it cool. The sun was already coming out and the wagon was full with people going to work. Then it happened: I began to feel like getting sick. Maybe it was the train movements that made me dizzy. I don’t know… Embarrassed to make a mess, drunk me assumed the inside of my backpack was the least bad place to puke. I proceeded to unzip it and let flow a waterfall of what felt like a full gallon of puke. 

Even though I was so drunk, I still remember the look of terror, pity, and disgust of the woman in front of me every time I raised my head to take a break before going at it again. 

Finally, I got rid of all my alcohol (and the chips, and a hamburger, and my vegetables… I think I even puked my breakfast!). I was feeling so much relief - then remembered my laptop and notebooks were inside the backpack. I got the laptop and notebooks out and they a dripping vomit. In the process, I smeared puke all over the sit. My friend was sitting on my side and I drop them on his lap without even asking, covering him in vomit as well. 

The notebooks were of no use after that, but the laptop somehow survived. 

Worst of all, the backpack turn out not to be water proof and vomit began leaking through the bottom, and I was still so brainlessly drunk that I didn’t feel it. So I was soaked in my own vomit by the time I got off the train. I was wearing a white summer dress that well… was never white anymore.

"TIFU Missed opportunity to talk to a girl who was eyeing me
Yesterday I was traveling back home from an event and stopped to get gas about an hour away from where I live. When I pull up to the gas pump on the other side is a very attractive girl my age (24), my type and everything. Now I don't talk to random girl like ever so I wasn't going to say anything and just go about my business of getting gas and going home.

However, whenever I glanced over at her she would make eye contact for a bit, until I instinctively dart my eyes away. At that point I'm thinking she is just noticing when I glanced over and that's all. But this happened a couple more times while I'm leaning on my car waiting. I noticed she was done pumping and now she's just sitting in her car and she kept looking over at me. And she didn't starting driving away until got in the car and left. 

Now I'm scared I missed an opportunity like she was waiting for me to say something to her. Unless my ability to read body language is completely wrong... The worst part is I knew what she was doing while I was still there and had the chance to say something, but I'm so petrified in situations like that with an attractive girl. Then afterwards driving home, mad I didn't take my chance afterwards. I know I'm never going to see her ever again and who knows what could have happened if I just said hi and maybe gave her my number.

"TIFU at work. Afraid of getting robbed.
Burner account for obvious reasons.

Started working as a cashier recently. Today a man and his wife come to the store. They grab some things.

They don't speak english, but I get to half-understand them. He pays and when I'm giving him the change he asks for ""an older bill"" because he ""collects them in his country"". I start to get nervous because he insists, I say no a few times but he is there staring at me and keeps asking. I'm so social anxious I was getting red and sweating so I was fucking blocked and ended showing him a lot of bills I had in my cash register. Like 500$. I know. I'm so fucking dumb, what was I thinking? I was so numb.

Then he finally gets angry because I don't give him anything and leaves the store.

Now I'm so fucking scared. This was a few hours ago. What if he was checking how much money was in the cash register to rob later? My heart is fucking racing right now and I can't think properly. I can't believe how am I so dumb.

I thought about calling the police but I don't know if I'm just paranoid, also it could cost me my job (which I would understand). Maybe he just wanted to scam me or something, but I'm terrified of getting robbed now.

"TIFU but was it on me?
Hey guys, Just recently lost a lot of weight and have started to go the clubs and have been getting a lot of attention from girls now who I find very attractive . So this last weekend I went out with some boys after a big college party and the bars were packed. Well waiting in line I start talking to this girl and we immediately hit it off. She ends up staying with me the entire night and ending up wanting to come home with me after her friends decided to leave after she told them she wanted to stay. Let me start by saying after she told me she wanted to come back to mine she said she didn’t want to have sex, and we had been talking about how we both went to church and were Christian (I think she was being genuine as she asked my brother to and her sister has “Jesus is king” in her bio (I was honest about how struggle with being always faithful) So we get back to my place and pretty much immediately go into my bed bed and start making out and she gets on top of my and starting riding with but with her shirt and underwear still on. So this pretty much goes on the whole night with her on top of me well I finger her and she like dry humps me and this happened the entire night In between us sleeping from like 2:30am to 10am and then I drove her home. I am a virgin and she isn’t but she was under the impression I wasn’t a virgin and she had guessed I had like 8 bodies I then told her I had 2 and she thought I was lying and it was way more. I just can’t believe a women would do all of this but not give me any sort of play (no sex, bj or hj) it got to the point where I told her I wanted to fuck her but she still said no and I respected her boundaries and just continued on with what we were doing. I asked her numerous times if she wanted to leave my house throughout the night to be nice and see if she was still comfortable but she kept wanting to stay at mine until I took her home. I’m just wondering if I missed a point to escalate it to sex but at the same time I don’t know what more I could have done. And unfortunately now she is seemingly ghosting me after texting me the day after. Like did I genuinely not escalate enough or did she really just want to have sex?

"TIFU by accidentally switching book bags and exposing my “sexual self-improvement” phase to my boss
So during my lunch break today, I decided to hit up a bookstore.

Trying to be better, learn more about myself, you know?

Picked up two books: one about sexual development and intimacy, the other about confidence in relationships.

All educational but let’s just say the covers don’t hold back.



Anyway, fast-forward to me back at the office, post-lunch.

Boss calls me into a quick meeting. I bring my stuff, drop my bag next to me.

We’re talking about quarterly reports or whatever.



At some point, I reach into what I think is my bag to grab a notebook.

Instead, I pull out “Awaken Your Inner Orgasm” and “The Sensual Brain”... in front of my very serious, very senior manager.



We both paused.

Time stopped.

Even the fluorescent lights flickered in shame.



Turns out I’d accidentally grabbed someone else’s book bag at the shop.

Mine had been switched and now I was not only the sexual wellness guy, but also the lunchtime kink reader.

Just raised one eyebrow like he’d unlocked a hidden HR side quest.

"TIFU by telling a pregnant woman she should drink ginger tea
So a couple of weeks ago I reunited with some family and friends, just a chill weekend night out. One of my family members (let’s call her Emma), decided to announce her pregnancy… and the table didn’t react well. Some factors to consider: 

She decided to quit her job now so her body would have time to rest and form a baby, her husband makes around 27.000€ per year. Also, days before they also got into debt to buy an used car. 

On top that, they had been getting more and more into church which had caused some incidents within our group of friends because they are prioritizing the church a lot. There is also a cultural expectation that you need to support your family financially if you make more money than them. 

Perfect storm for a really awkward moment. 

So, her brother is losing his shit because he needs to support a child now, her sister-in-law is questioning her about getting a new job and medical stuff, others are asking if it was planned or an accident… the congratulations were left in the background. 

So, tensions are high, Emma is on the verge of tears after some stiff hugs and congrats. Other people and I try to salvage the situation by saying some supportive stuff like “I’m sure everything will work out!”, “let us know if you need help!”, etc. 

I, in my all time brilliantness, try to google remedies for morning sickness, since she mentioned how much of a hard time she was having with it. One cure comes up from the depths of google: Ginger tea!

“Hahaha” I think, “she would surely appreciate it! This will help defuse the tension!” 

I tell her with a smile “Why don’t you drink some ginger tea tomorrow? It will surely make you feel better”. And with that, another awkward silence falls over the table and I seal my fate as the Ginger Woman for the next couple of weeks. 

Apparently, as Emma and other older women informed me, ginger is an abortive. I was kind-of implying she should yeet the baby and save us all the trouble. Emma didn’t react well, she got more upset and emotional.

Doctor Google failed me once again. 

At least, it wasn’t a complete fuckup? It shifted some of the tension of the table into mocking my ignorant faux-pass (Excuse me! Being a woman doesn’t include some inherent knowledge about abortive ingredients!). Emma started crying and the reunion ended a bit later. 

Things are better now in the family, but I’m now know as the Woman Who Offers Abortives to Pregnant Woman (because my family loves to poke fun of people). Even now weeks laters, Emma mentions the ginger incident each time we see each other, and honestly, she says it with a bit of a dig each time, and I don’t wish to correct her because I feel it will cause more conflict and awkwardness.","A family member got pregnant, the family didn’t take it well. I googled how to help her with the morning sickness, and offered to buy her ginger tea, which she thinks is an abortive, she did not like that and got upset. I’m now the Ginger Woman.

"TIFU by wanting to smoke a joint on my 3rd story patio
Ive been feeling like shit lately living an unhealthy drug/alcohol heavy sedentary lifestyle for what seems like way too long, so this week i decided i wanted to go atleast a week of living a much healthier lifestyle and hope i can feel better/force some healthier habits on me. I decided to give up smoking pot, drinking, and eating meat for the most part and make an active attempt to do 30 mins of cardio and calisthenics plus eating an extremely lighter diet consisting of mostly fruits, vegetables, fish, starches, grain, and dairy. So basically cutting out meat and junk food. I only drink soda/juice when i drink alcohol so switching to only water hasnt been an issue at all. 

After a few days of this i decided to reward myself with a smoke before bed. The main reason i smoke pot is to help me sleep because of hard insomnia so the last few nights of trying to sleep have lasted 1-2 hours. Pot doesnt always help, but it helps more than sleeping pills, anti-anxiety meds, melatonin, stretching, different positions, etc. Normally id use my bong and a sploof inside but its extremely nice outside and i have a gorgeous view of forest area right outside my balcony so i decided to treat myself with a nice sit outside and a joint. No biggie. 

On the top floor and being directly at the end building with no view of the street/parking lot has its perks since nobody can see my entire balcony unless they go in the buildings backyard and come basically to the end and id hear/see them long before they see me. So smoking has never been an issue for me on my patio. (Not legal here)

Well its extremely nice but decently windy today so lighting my joint was a bit of a nuisance but i handled it. After a few hits the wind took it out and as i was lighting it again, a gust pushed the joint right out of my hands inbetween the cracks of my patio floor and fell directly into my neighbor-below-me's very barren plant garden. I just wanted to relax and reward myself 😭 

Not wanting to be a shitty neighbor and also possibly get in trouble or get my neighbor into something, i knew i had to get it out, BUT HOW like I cant just monkey my way down there and i know my neighbor isnt even home to go to her door and tell her about the fuck up. So i have the bright idea to jerry-rig a contraption to get the joint from the plant bed a solid 10+ feet underneath my patio.

My first attempt was a cat fishing rod i have that i pinned to a ladle i have (its a dinosaur 🦕) and try to toss it over the side and scoop it out. I laid flat on my wooden floor and tossed it over the side and guided it with my arm dangling over the side. It did not feel great with the wood scratching the inside of my elbow but I was able to reach it! However , no dice. The joint wouldn't get in and it seemed to push it down into the dirt more than anything.

My second attempt involved using the cat fishing pole and an ashtray! Hoping since it was more level it would scoop in easier. As i was doing this, i noticed a lady down below in the backyard area walking her dog but i DONT think she noticed my crazy ass lol. I did go inside for a bit.  Unfortunately, still nothing when i went back. I got close, but it never landed. Im a solid 30 mins in.

My next thought was to go through the slits Inbetween the wood. I taped a bunch of colored pencils end to end and put two sewing needles at the end and hoped to stab it and pull it through but there wasnt a single area I could fit the pencils through and angle it correctly. 

Has to be about an hour in. Im miserable. I just dont wanna be a dick and leave it or get heat for it, so i decide to hit the jimmy neutron and brainstorm. 

I GOT IT. The issue with the pencils was thickness but the idea was right. I needed a way to stab it from 10+ feet out, but it had to be thin enough to fit through the slits of the patio floor. I have a fuck ton of bulk tcg cards. The plan was to tape .5 centimeter thick stacks end to end that were thin enough to fit through the crack, but stable enough to push sewing needles into the joint ontop of dirt and pull it back up to me. 

After about 1:30 of effort, i finally managed  to tape all of the cards end to end in a 12ish foot card snake with sewing needle fangs at the end. And of COURSE my luck would be that a wasp is guarding my patio railing. I swear i just cant win today. But after checking to make sure my neighbor was still gone and donning a hoodie, i braved the outdoors and remained focused. I looked down to see where the joint was and where i needed to drop the cards, and after a few attempts, i lined it up! I slide it down and wait for a gust of wind to blow the cards over the side of the garden container so it can be inside of the walls. After a few minutes of stabbing around, i nailed it! Slowly I pull each scale of the card snake up one by one until the joint is just at the edge of the underneath the wooden floor boards. Its spinning as only one needle hit it. I CANT be too fast otherwise I risk it sliding off an landing on my neighbors floor and i end up truly fucked without a way to get it. Slowly it spins as i pull it up, and it comes through! After SO. God damned long, i have retrieved the empty wrapper of my joint. 

I immediately went inside and took a hit from my bong like i should've done in the first place. Thats what i get for trying to enjoy nature lmao

TL:DR: I wanted to reward myself with a nice joint outside, dropped it into my neighbors plant garden 10 feet below me, and spent almost 2 hours i shouldve been relaxing having a good time before bed McGuyvering different contraptions to retrieve the emptied paper evidence out of there. Dont do drugs kids.",,Smoked a joint on my patio and fell into my neighbor's garden.

*•* Brother (5M) told him if he stopped misbehaving and targeting me I would give him pie, he hasn’t stopped so I stuck to my word after double checking with my mom, sister, and an Am I The asshole variant subreddit when declared a douche but not an ass. 

—————————————————————————

People say my cooking is good but I noticed a reoccurring issue, i can’t properly control how to get it to look good without messing up the taste slightly. This is specific to sweets and baking Nothing drastic but details that can make difference between getting seconds or not. So during spring break I decided to practice 3 meals in my problem area. Since prom is coming up the theme is desserts. Key lime Pie, Yogurt, Chewy Caramel candy. Trying to make sweets to get a sweetie.

**Normally either my Mother or my Grandmother would buy the ingredients, but my gut was screaming at me to get it myself this time as I might get guilt tripped for not making my brother any.** 

I asked my mom for $30 in exchange for chores, cleaned the garage and before I did the other stuff she gave me an extra $20 because she loved it so much. My Aunt C gave me $20 randomly and I appreciated it. 

I got $60 worth of ingredients for a good deal. When making a pie batter my grandmother came back from smoking and was on the phone with my aunt E, she saw the food and complimented me and asked if I was planning on sharing, I said yes and offered my grandmother some, she declined.


**I told my mom in advance I made pie, wasn’t giving any to my brother who was misbehaving, and I offered it to my grandmother who doesn’t normally eat my food and she said no twice. She understood.**

When baking it I asked for her input since this the first time I make pie outside of class (officially my second time), she made pie before so I thought I should ask. When she told me to let it cool i specifically asked her again if she wanted some, she said no. I do have autism so maybe this isn’t normal but I normally ask 2 times in the cooking process, the before and after phase. Whatever you say on the second phase is your answer, I’m not going to beg you. When I cook outside of class I dont offer it unless it’s my second time making it, as to not make anyone sick. I am my own test subject until I’m confident but I made an exception because of the dish, it actually turned out great, I probably should have put it in for 5 more minutes but it was overall pleasant and the flavor was good.

**When done she went to sleep, I texted my mom, asked if she wanted me to put half a pie in in her mini fridge so she could have some, she said yes so I did. Later my grandmother was leaving as I was coming downstairs and lectured me because I refused to make her or my brother any, specifically that I never offered her any, I corrected her and she said I never did. She said she was going out to buy them a pie and not to touch it. In that moment I was glad I used my chore money so I had some leverage, told my mom, and my aunt E who was on the phone, my sister, and they all agreed with me that I was in the right. For weeks my grandmother has been gaslighting, and lecturing me on my disrespectful behavior when in relativity she was having memory issues. When they came back they didn’t have any but it would have been funny if it was also key lime**

If I didn’t know any better She probably wanted me to cut her a slice and hand it to her, but that’s rude imo so I didn’t. 

Before you ask how I ate a whole pie and half a can of cool whip by myself, it was a small pre made crust, there’s no damn way I’m tackling dough for a long time. My mom said I can give my grandmother and brother her pie to calm them but I told her “Love you mom, you keep me sane, I think she’s going to be mad regardless so I’d rather you have it since I know your chill like that”. 

I refuse to be a kiss ass since she’s getting angrier with age. My grandmother has been gaslighting me and been making me question my own memories for months since she been here, now when I do something I have to get witness so she can’t lie about what I do.","Made Pie, Grandma is mad I didn’t offer her some when I did twice with a witness, on the phone. She’s also mad I didn’t make any for my brother who was misbehaving and I didn’t want to reward. I brought ll ingredients myself",I made a whole pie and ate it by myself.
"TIFU by checking my Instagram suggested profiles
TIFU as I was scrolling through Instagram. I saw the ""suggested for you"" tab with a bunch of profiles I might recognize. I was scrolling through them, a few were familiar but not interesting, then one stood out in particular. I hadn't seen it before, but it had a design style and name that was suspiciously familiar. I clicked into the account, and the first thing I see is that my mom and aunt both follow this account. I think, okay that explains why it was recommended. Then I actually take in what this account is. It's a photography account for a private bedroom photo business. Now my mother is an entrepreneur, and with the branding of this account, it was too similar for me to let go. I hesitantly scroll down the feed, and sure enough, my mother's face is publicly advertising the business and worse, participating in the type of photos they offer. Definitely things I didn't need to see. Now if this was just a new thing that would be one thing, but my mother also works in a business that heavily has to do with kids. I personally am disgusted, but I also think this was a dumb thing to do publicly with her other line of work if parents end up seeing that.",I saw my mom's boudoir business account on insta with her in the photos.

"TIFU by trying to shut off my sisters macbook.
So I 17M was scrolling instagram reels and I saw this reel that was like ""new school hack"" and it showed a kid rubbing the lid part of his opened airpod case against the right side of his friends computer keyboard and it caused the screen to flicker and then go black and the computer signs out. 

So I wanted to try this and we were on a roadtrip in my family's RV and since my computer was stored away and my sisters was out. I opened her macbook(refurbished and like already damaged a bit, theres a small hole in the bottom of the screen which apparently didn't affect anything) and tried it on there. I did what the kid in the reel did but instead of shutting off, it caused a few black horizontal lines to appear on the bottom of the screen. 

I'm not sure if maybe i was moving the case really fast and accidently hit her screen or it was the airpod case and like magnets which caused the screen to glitch. Nonetheless, the lines don't go away, and as my sister tries to fix it(by restarting it and then slamming her hand on it), they get worse. currently the bottom 1/5 of her screen is just black lines. My parents are claiming that I need to pay for the damages once they get it fixed.","Tried to use my airpod case to shut off my sister computer, cause horizontal lines to appear on the screen.",I tried to shut off my sisters macbook and it caused black lines to appear on the bottom of the screen.

"TIFU By listening to music while drying my hair
I like to listen to music/podcasts/whatever while in the shower. This morning, my wife is having a lay in so I pop my ear buds in as to not disturb her and get ready to have a shower.

Obviously I can't shower with them in so on the side they go, I shower, get out, dry my hair and put ear buds in. As I do, I feel my hair could do with a bit more drying.

So I put my towel over my head and give a vigorous rub. Suddenly, it goes quiet in my right ear, a small black object catches my eye and I look down to see my right ear bud heading towards the toilet bowl.

As I give a mental ""oh shit!"", the ear buds bounces on the rim a few times before finally falling towards the floor, not going for a swim in the khazi.

After I finish having a heart attack, stroke and brain aneurysm in one go, I do the sensible thing and put my ear buds on the side FAR away from any liquids while I dry myself and get changed.

Remember kids, electronics and water don't mix.

TL:DR I was drying my hair with ear buds in too close to the toilet and one nearly fell in.",,I put my ear buds in too close to the toilet and one nearly fell in.
"TIFU by getting alcohol poisoning.

Hi guys, sorry if this is a lot!  Basically I almost died and am in recovery but I feel like I traumatized myself, I know I'm under the age of drinking and I shouldn't have done it, I got alcohol poisoning and was rushed to the hospital. I don't even remember the day anymore, all I remember is waking up in the hospital with a bunch of IVs and stuff in me and puking a lot. I feel horrible. They had to stick me like 9 something times 
My BAC was way above the limit, over 1.89. I don't know what to do with myself I'm a mess right now. I could have died. I almost did die. 

(Not really funny, but funny nonetheless.)
Apparently I also was rolling on the floor puking like a dying porpus in my dirty room and squealing.. And I was also naked and they had to make me roll down the stairs WHILE NAKED because I couldn't walk or even move on my own. Only really seize out. Now my stomach is upset and my body feels like it's failing.
I was so out of it I kept repeating I wanted to die. Don't remember that but was put on suicide watch.

"TIFU by choking on a cinnamon stick while trying to impress a girl
I was at this new café near my office, trying to act all mysterious and put-together — headphones in, laptop open, latte in hand. You know the vibe.

There’s this girl sitting across from me. Cute, reading a book. I think, ""Okay... this is my main character moment."" I order a fancy chai latte (which I don’t even drink) just to seem cultural and deep.

They bring it in a glass mug — aesthetic AF — with a cinnamon stick floating on top. I take a sip. It burns a little. Whatever. I keep looking casually in her direction, hoping to lock eyes and maybe flash a half-smile.

Then I take a big sip. The cinnamon stick goes straight into my mouth and gets lodged sideways in my throat.

I start choking. Not like little cough-choke. I’m full on turning red, trying to cough it out while covering my mouth, looking like I’m dying in slow motion. People are turning around. The barista is confused. The girl is STAAAARING.

I manage to spit the damn stick out into a tissue. It's soaked in chai and shame.

I try to act normal after like nothing happened, but the girl just got up, smiled politely (painfully), and walked away.",Tried to look cool in front of a cute girl.

"TIFU. Accidentally went to a networking event for black people… I am white…
Accidentally went to a networking event for black people… I am white…

I feel terrible. I feel I’ve really messed up here and I am mortified.

I’ve been out of a job for ages, so when I saw a post on LinkedIn about a networking event hosted by one company at a different company’s venue that said it was “ an event open to everyone working in [my industry] looking to network with people who work in [roles like mine]” I jumped at the chance and rsvp’d to the email in the post… 

I should have looked up the hosting company - it’s actually not a company, it’s a network for “black people who work in [my industry].

I am a white woman with blonde hair, so when I arrived at the event, I realised my mistake… and probably so did everyone else. I had 2 choices when I realised:

1. Make a fake excuse and leave the event immediately, so that I’m out of the way, but this could have been offensive, like I didn’t want to be there
2. Stay, open mind, open heart - try to listen and see if I can learn how to be a better ally to level up those who are more junior in this industry than me. And do the networking

I chose option 2. Was that the right choice?

Everyone I spoke to was so lovely and welcoming, particularly the hosts, and I did some networking, but I can’t shake the guilt and embarrassment. I’m such an idiot. I literally cried all the way back home (over 1 hour) and can’t stop.

Should I message the hosts to apologise profusely? How do I make this right? Is it better just to leave it?

I want to say that I am so sorry for not doing research into the people hosting the event and for taking that ticket which meant that someone else didn’t get one, and also for potentially making it a less safe-feeling space for everyone else there.

It would be good to understand if an apology would be well-received or if it would make it even worse? Did I do the right thing in staying rather than just leaving? Am I blowing this out of proportion or did I really mess up badly?","I am a white woman, and I thought I was going to a certain event, but it turned out it was an event hosted by a network for black professionals in my industry.

"TIFU by killing the school copier.
Saw another copy machine-related TIFU, so I thought I’d add mine.  

In the late 90’s I did my student teaching at a small rural district. They had one copier and had someone to make the copies for anyone who needed them.  

All you had to do was leave the papers you needed copies with a sticky note of instructions and the copies would be done within a period.  

She was a sweet older lady, very nice, but very slow.  She also took long coffee breaks so she wasn’t always in the room.  

One day during my second week. I had some papers that I wanted her to copy onto transparency sheets.  She wasn’t in the room so…

I found some transparency sheets in a cabinet, loaded them in one of the trays, inserted my papers and pressed start.

Apparently there are transparency sheets that can go through a copier and there are transparency sheets that can’t.  It was only milliseconds after pressing start, the copier made some groaning noise and stopped.

Milliseconds after that the copy lady came in and caught me red handed, and for someone I thought was a sweet old lady, she said some not so sweet things.

The copier had melted plastic all through its innards and was down for a few days while they waited for a service call.  I got a strong talking to by my cooperating teacher and the superintendent.  Also every teacher in the building knew it was me, and managed to both avoid me like the plague and give me death stares in the hall.  I couldn’t wait to finish my time there.  Needless to say, I wasn’t offered a job there and didn’t even put them down as a reference.",". attempted to use the wrong type of transparency sheets in the school copier as a student teacher, broke the copier and turned the whole school against me.","Copier melted, I killed the copier."
"TIFU by being the worlds most awkward customer.
TIFU by being the most awkward customer at my local grocery store. I stopped by after work to get some stuff we needed for dinner.

One of the items needed was the heat-and-go macaroni and Cheese dishes that we plan on having as a side. The Bob Evans brand specifically (It's important). So I looked around the store a bit but couldn't find it, so I asked an employee for help. Unfortunately I was not sure of the brand name and said with my full chest 'Do you know where the Bob Ross mac and Cheese is?' Yup you read me right. Bob Ross, famous painter. She chuckled a bit and started showing me where it was, and in my embarrassment instead of saying 'Thank you.' When we found it, I said 'Happy little cheese', then grabbed the product and walked away.

'But OP,' you say, 'that's not that bad' just you wait reader, there's more.

I grab the rest of my items and head towards the registers when I see an employee I recognize. A cute guy, who's previously expressed interest in me, and I decide to try and pay him a compliment without disturbing his working. So I approach him ready to compliment him but instead of being slick and saying a proper sentence, I trip over my own feet and fully slam all 200lbs of my manish figure onto  the floor right next to him spilling  the contents of my basket everywhere. He helps me up, hands me my Bob Ross mac and cheese, and I mutter a quiet 'thank you' before speed walking to the farthest legal register pay for my items and leave.

 But of course I don't stop there. I really should have stopped there. Instead of leaving, I put my bag in the car and head back in to try and compliment him and apologize for my clumsiness, but he's busy talking to and coworker and I feel too awkward, so I start browsing the nearest aisle end cap and waiting for him to break his convo. Turns out, I was standing there with a limp leg browsing random gift cards and fuzzy socks for like 5 minutes before he walks away not noticing me. I'm currently defeated reader.

"TIFU by not clearing off my bed before going to sleep
This story is quite short but also a little funny

I usually clear everything off my bed like books and some school supplies and other stuff before going to sleep but last night I was so tired (I was doing homework late last night while browsing reddit and went to bed around 3-4 AM)  so I just fell asleep and didn't bother clearing off my bed. One of those items was a little Spiderman action figure (like around 6 inches tall)

Well this morning I woke up with my back hurting like crazy and I was super confused as I didn't do anything yesterday that caused my back to hurt. That is until I went to get dressed for the day and Spidey fell right off my back (I tend to sleep shirtless as it often gets crazy hot in my room)

As it turned out I slept right on top of the Spiderman toy (I roll around a lot in my sleep and must have rolled right on top of it) which is what caused my back to hurt. The Spiderman figure had his hands permanently molded into the web shooting pose and well the fingers were digging into my back, and it didn't help that the toy was made out of a super hard plastic (like if you threw it hard at a wall it would survive and not break into a million little pieces)

It is currently noon and my back still hurts",Didn't bother clearing off my bed before going to bed last night and slept on top of a Spiderman toy causing my back to hurt,I slept on top of a Spiderman toy and my back still hurts
"TIFU Waited too long to do taxes.
I have always been the one to remind my parents to make appointments, so they don't wait at the last minute to them. Back in Januaury ads for tax submitting have been popping up and remind me my mom to make an appointment with her accountant to do hers. She mentions she would called them later, for she just wanted to her shows. Late February I remember asking her if she made the appointment, she said no and again says ill do it later. There been times in which she waits till is too late, so I grab her phone and say do it now so you have an appointment before its too late. Annoyed she calls and gets the last minute addition before the deadline. ""See what happens when you wait too late"" I explain to her otherwise there wouldn't be any appointment.

My parents and I share the same accountant and today is the day for the appointment to do my taxes. To get things ready I went to check online with QuickBooks for my w-2 forms to prepare to file. Unfortunately, I keep getting an error with the site and have trouble logging on. With today being a Sunday getting any contact before meeting would be futile, and all of this is have to be resolve till Monday with them. What sucks now is  rescheduling with my accountant would be after the deadline. Now the W-2s in question is from a job I have been fired from and getting to worked with them to resolve this issue is going to be a headache, as for they been notorious to respond in time, and lack of communication in general. I hate procrastinated, but for some reason it would be easy to  just download my w-2s and this error mishappens, so now I'm screwed.

"TIFU by going to the toilet Butters Stotch style
This happened 30 minutes ago and I am going back and forth between finding it hilarious and being incredibly embarrassed. I am working in my office on a Friday, so it is basically empty as most people work from home. I came in because I have a complex piece of work and really need to concentrate, and there are just too many distractions at home.

So I'm working away, totally in my own little world, with nobody around me, and the urge to urinate edges into my consciousness. I get up, still pondering the work I am doing, and head to the men's bathroom. I am on full autopilot, the work challenge circling around my brain. I head over to the urinal and go about my business. 

Suddenly the toilet door opens, in an instant my closed world bursts open, and I realise in my autopilot I was peeing Butters Stotch style - my pants down, bare arsed for the world to see. I am actively peeing however, and so cannot lean down to pull my pants up. I look over at the door, and a man walks in. We make eye contact.

So this happened last night and I’m still not emotionally okay.

I keep a drawer in my nightstand with… “supplies.” Let’s just say I was in the mood and trying to have a little solo fun. It was dark, I didn’t want to turn on the light, and I grabbed the bottle I *thought* was lube. Same size, similar shape. You already know where this is going.

About 20 seconds in, I realized something was off. The texture wasn’t right, and it started to *burn*. I turned on the light, looked at the bottle, and wanted to scream. Gorilla. Glue. Not some off-brand glue. No, I went full industrial strength.

I used to be a horrid kid in my childhood but chilled out in my pre teens. so I got good at predicting his moves when he’s pissed, I just imagine him as a past me. He already broke a TV, His tablet several times, my sisters laptop, my moms screen, my switch’s joycon so I’m prepared now.

I tried the “gentle parenting” method but after a while my patience is running thin. While my grandmother whos our temporary guardian, claimed she couldn’t hear or see him chucking shoes at me and him yelling “I hate you” even though she was right next me me. She barely punished him.

So I chased him up the stairs, he started crying and calling for grandma, so when I backed off out of guilt he would stop crying immediately then keep it up again. So like the responsible older brother I backed him into the same corner and told him to knock it off, he started fake crying. Then I was so mad any sense of reason left my body, I said “I ain’t new to this I can cry too” I squatted to his eye level and did the most obnoxious cry I could do. I did the classic big inhale cry, then beautifully transitioned it into the classic “WAAAAAAA” before i broke character and started laughing. We deadass started harmonizing. He started crawling backwards and I was walking towards him while we were both crying at each other. He was mad and freaked out to snitch on me to our grandmother but I swear I saw him crack a smile. 

I remember crying so much as a kid that I knew how to do it in a way to annoy people the most. Long note, then random scream at random intervals Like waaaaaaHAAAAAAaaaaaa.

It’s better than straight up screaming so your ears can’t fully adjust.

When she came to confront my brother, oops I mean comfort, I said “HA Crocodile tears”. My grandmother said im almost 18 and im being an asshole to a baby who apparently looks up to me, whenever he does something to me she doesn’t care unless it affects her but the second I retaliate the immediately notices. She has a short fuse with me now but I was ready to burn that bridge anyway. I had the same thing happen with my sister (18F) growing up when we argued. I told my sister what I did and she started laughing when I told her.

Thank god I’m getting a dorm.


Was I acting like an ass?",I'm a bitch.
"TIFU by getting my mom addicted to Pokémon cards
This has been a slow-burning disaster of my own making. It all started when I asked my mom for a favor. Just for and age ref I'm (19F)
My mom is (57F)

I’m casually into Pokémon cards, mostly for nostalgia, and because the last packs I ever opened were from paldean fates. A while ago, I found this gorgeous box that was only being sold in Japan (the flareon box with the cool deck holder inside) . I couldn’t easily order it myself, so I asked my mom (who has a plug in japan) to help me get it.

103 dollars later, She did. The box arrived. I opened a couple of packs with her. It was a nice moment, but that's only the beginning.

Little did I know. I created a monster.

At first, she wasn't like obsessed. It actually took her a while to get there. Every now and then, she'd ask me what packs were cool and what was relevant or what I wanted for Christmas and whatnot.
Then She discovered Pokémon card openings on TikTok—specifically, rip till you hit streams. And now that’s our thing. We rarely open packs ourselves due to the inflation and disappearance of said packs and ETBs, so We just sit on TikTok watching some guy tear through boxes of Terastal Festival She’ll yell out, “Okay, one more pack—he’s getting close!” And then ten minutes later, we'll pull an eeveelution SAR, and the spiral continues. Right now, she's been on an insane luck streak it went Leafeon, jolteon, an espeon, 2 glaceons in a row! And now flareon is the latest. 
But Her favorite Pokémon? Leafeon. Especially since her favorite color is green, and it was one of the first bigger pulls she's ever gotten.


Anyway, there was probably a good 1000$ or more into the endeavor with bills to pay and an angry father and husband asking us to stop. But I do enjoy teaching her everything there is to know about the Pokémon world, and the fact that I've gotten my mom into a hobby we can both enjoy makes me extremely happy. I truly am greatful for the time we spend together, through shitty packs to the biggest of pulls!

So yeah. TIFU by asking my mom to help me buy a Japanese Pokémon box. Now she’s a rip-stream-watching, Leafeon-loving, pull-rate-calculating Pokéfiend.","What started as a simple favor—asking my mom to help me buy a Japanese Pokémon card box—spiraled into a full-blown shared obsession with Pokémon cards, especially watching rip streams on TikTok. Now she's a Leafeon-loving, pull-obsessed Pokéfiend, and while we’ve likely spent over $1,000, I’m genuinely grateful for the unexpected bonding experience. But wowza lotta money.

"TIFU by emptying a 3-hole punch waste tray
Well this happened a few days ago, but the consequences just arrived moments ago.

I work in a small office of only 3-4 people. My boss replaced our crummy printer with a brand new printer 3 months ago. It was a remarkable printer, perhaps too heavy duty for the amount of printing we do, but a welcome upgrade.

One thing I was NOT fond of regarding this new printer was how it sounded when opening the doors to replace toner, fix paper jams, or conduct any other maintenance duties. I'm used to office equipment doors that softly *click* when I open or shut them. This new printer made harsh CRACKS and SNAPS when opening or closing anything, and it often required such force, that I'd be afraid I was trying to open something that doesn't open.

One pleasant feature of our new printer was that it could 3-Hole Punch anything we printed. I used this quite a bit. Last Monday, I forgot to take my ADHD meds. My mind kinda jumps from task to task at random and even though I hadn't used the 3-hole punch feature of the printer that day, I thought to myself ""I should figure out how to dispose of the 3-hole punch circles in the printer!""

I opened a few of the doors of the printer, searching for a waste tray. 

Couldn't find it.

Searched on YouTube for instructions. Found a model close enough to my printer, seemed simple enough to empty.

I found a black ""tray,"" but it was screwed shut. I thought that it was weird that a hole punch waste tray would be screwed shut, but shrugged it off... I was really determined to dispose of these hole punches. After I unscrewed it, the tray only came out a little bit. Again, most things with this printer required a suspicious amount of force to open  in the first place, so I just rolled with it.

***CCRACKK***

I immediately realized that this was not the 3-hole punch waste tray and that I fucked up. I tried pushing the tray back in... which made even more cracking noises... and got it just barely into a position that I could screw it back in.

I closed all the doors and exited out of the maintenance notice message on the screen of the printer. I tried to print something, and it made some awful noises, but it started to work! Until the end. The paper wouldn't come all the way out of the printer, it would jam up every time. It *would* print just fine, but the paper would get all crinkled up and stuck every time. I was the only one in the office at the time, so I just made the responsible decision to ignore it without telling a soul.

I came into work yesterday morning and everybody was there. I was hoping we could go a day without any printing, but within 20 seconds of me sitting down, I heard the printer going. My desk is right next to the printer, the other 3 office rooms are further down the hall, so I guess they didn't hear it so I pretended not to hear it as well.

Then I heard the printer going again and my boss walked in to retrieve his papers. He unjammed the paper and asked if I had any issues with the printer the past few days. I told him I did, but thought it was just a random paper jam. He started inspecting the printer, but couldn't figure out what the issue was. He had me call for an inspection.

The maintenance guy just left about an hour ago and this fuckin asshole told my boss that there's no way it was a manufacturing error. Somebody had to have broken this part with force. My boss looked at me and asked me if I  did something to the printer. I lied by telling him that I did when I was trying to fix the paper jam issue yesterday and that I maybe accidentally bumped something I wasn't supposed to. I don't know why I lied, I'm generally honest. I guess I thought I was in too deep to turn around.

Anyway, gonna cost $600-900 to repair. We're using the old one for now. Additionally, I just found the 3-hole punch tray and it was only about 5% full.","I attempted to empty my new office printer's three-hole punch paper waste tray, but broke an expensive part of the printer instead.",TIFU by emptying a 3-hole punch waste tray.
"TIFU by bleaching my hair but running out of…well, bleach.

There I was. I’ve been planning on bleaching my hair for weeks. Bought all the supplies weeks ago. I did a pretty good job last time, my first time, and I was better prepared to do it well this time. Even bought an extra packet. I only needed one last time, but you know. Going to be prepared for once. 

I actually sectioned my hair this time. Things are going great. Then I realize I’m using a brush this time and it’s taking me much longer than last time.

I started with one packet then rushed to blend a second about half way through. 

But somehow, I have the largest section left. You know, all of the VERY VISIBLE hair on the top of my head. 

And I run out. 

Like, barely started. 

And. It’s 2 am so I can’t get my husband to run to the store. 

I have bought bleach a couple of times before but never got around to it, so I should have two extra boxes here somewhere. Knowing me, I chucked them out. So I’ve been running around like a banshee in my adhd destroyed habit

So….imma let everything else process and I’m taking the day off tomorrow to fix it.

"TIFU I have a problem with mu gf

My GF (22) and me (22) have been in a relationship for four years. In the last six months, we’ve had a crisis, which is mostly due to her.

 When we met, she had a normal Instagram profile with about 300 followers, but a year ago, she decided to make it public, and that led to her having over 5000 followers today, many of them men. She started posting “thirst traps” around the time she unlocked her profile. At first, she posted somewhat okay pictures and rarely, but then she started doing it more often and posted pictures in swimsuits or clothing that accentuates her figure, posing in ways that highlight it. It didn’t bother me because I’m generally liberal and not possessive, but once it crossed a line (when she posted a picture of her butt in a swimsuit), I brought it up, saying it bothered me. She then started attacking me, calling me jealous, possessive, and saying I lacked confidence.

 I decided to let it go and accept that she just wanted to feel good about her body, but my doubts grew more and more...

In general, every time I tried to talk about it, it ended with her labeling me as possessive and insecure. We used to travel together all the time, but this year, for the first time, she expressed a desire to travel without me, with her friends. I was fine with that, but it bothered me that she wouldn’t text me the entire day, sometimes even the entire night. I understood that she wanted to explore the city, but it really bothered me that she couldn’t take a minute in 24 hours to text me. Again, it ended the same way: she attacked me.

Anyway, things came to a head 10 days ago when I told her that due to my current financial situation, I wouldn’t be able to go to the summer holiday. She decided to go with her friends first to Zakynthos, then to Ibiza—everyone’s single. That’s when I had enough and made it clear that all of this bothered me, and she responded that I was annoying her and that she was feeling saturated with the relationship. She said she wanted to take a break, and since then, she’s been going out partying every night and even went to Rome for a weekend... she even followed some new guys on Instagram.

I contacted her, and she replied two days later, saying she wanted space and that I should reach out when I “sort myself out.” After that, she didn’t even open the messages I sent.

What should I do? Has she just decided to ghost me, or does she want to be with other guys and then come back to the relationship?","We’ve been together 4 years, but in the last year she changed—posting thirst traps, partying, traveling without texting me at all, soon traveling to Zakynthos and Ibiza.

Not sure if she’s coming back.","Girlfriend of four years started posting more and more pictures of her body on Instagram, and now she’s going out partying every night and even going to Rome for a weekend.

"TIFU by not exiting the elevator at work.
I work in a 5 story office building and work on the 5th floor. The day ends and I go to the elevator. 75% of the employees just take the stairs but I like to be different. I go in and press 1. The elevator stops at floor 4 to pick up a woman who I will call Elizabeth, instead of her real name for the sake of the story. Whenever we reach the bottom I tell Elizabeth ladies first and offer her to exit. Elizabeth refuses and says ""you go first, I'll go next"" and I told her I insist. We got stuck in this loop of ladies first and you go first. Eventually elevator was open too long and it went back up. Stopped around the 2 or 3 range. 2.5!

"TIFU by giving my wife and I a near lethal dose of caffeine in a smoothie
This happened last week, but another post reminded me.

So my wife and i just got a blender. We saved up for it on our poverty income, and it means a lot to both of us that we can now make out own soups and smoothies cause we'll save a bunch of money. Because moneys still tight, we started by lightly experimenting with a few frozen fruits, but I wanted to really kick it up a notch.

We had to deep clean our whole house for a visit recently, so I figured Id make us a smoothie thatd keep us on our feet for a while: frozen banana, yogurt, oat milk, peanut butter, and instant coffee. I was half winging it, half following a guide since Im new to making smoothies and wanted a good consistency. 

Recipe called for 3tbsps of instant coffee, which I didnt even think about because the blender we got is pretty big (we splashed out for a higher end one so we wouldnt have to spend more to replace it later. Its something like 8 cups, plus a bunch of inserts and settings). I made the smoothie, served it, and that was that. Consistency was awesome, but gf complained that it ""hit her in the face"" with coffee taste, so we dumped it back in and added some sugar. Taste was fixed, and we sat to enjoy our wonderful, tasty treat.

... and then my vision went a little weird.

Neither of us have been drinking coffee for a few weeks. We moved to tea after a bad flu that knocked us both on out asses for a while. I figured my caffiene tolerance was just low. Then my gf started saying her heart was beating really fast. 

For some extra context in this, my wife and i are both anorexic. Im not super low-weight, but she looks like those warning ads you show teen girls to scare them away from eds. Shes already got risks to her health due to that, so when she says her hearts hurting, Im at immediate attention. 

I checked the recipe again, and it was 3tsps. Not tablespoons. Teaspoons.

Id had half of a regular glass at that point, and my gf had had 3/4 of hers. I immediately grabbed them both, along with the rest of the smoothie (id made enough for 2 cups each) and mason jarred it all for the freezer. We've been having a spoonful a day to wake up since, but no more.

It took 3hrs for both of us to feel normal again.  Ive ODed on caffiene in the past, and spent time in the hospital for it, so Im usually super careful. We did the math, and the smoothie had around 50-70mg of caffiene per serving. A monster can, for comparison, has 36mg of caffiene per 100g, along with a warning to only drink 1 a day, so my smoothie was like shotgunning 2 of those.

I joked that I saw shrimp colors, and gf mock-complained that I tried to give her a heart attack. The smoothies name is now ""Ball Buster,"" and it IS a good pick me up, in moderation.

Ive been reading recipes a lot slower since.","I misread a smoothie recipe as tbsps instead of tsps, almost knocked myself and my wife flat on our asses from the amount of caffiene we drank",I gave my wife and I a near lethal dose of caffeine in a smoothie.

"TIFU by doing an impression of a certain singer
So I met this girl from work, we are not in a relationship nor officially dating but we always grab dinner together after work. Sometimes with our other colleagues but usually just the two of us. I like her but I don't want to rush things.

Earlier tonight I was driving her home, and we were playing music in my car. Suddenly a Joji song played, and she got excited and said, ""Oh wow I didn't know you listen to Joji."" I just said ""Yeah I vibe with him."" She followed up with ""Did you know he used to be Filthy Frank?"" I was trying to stop the autist in me so I just replied, ""Oh yeah?"" She said, ""Yes I used to watch him back in high school!"" I couldn't stop myself, so I did a pink guy face. The one I did was the pink guy thumbs up.

She said ""What are you doing?"" and for some fucking reason I decided to double down by saying ""ey b0ss"" while still doing the face."" I also said ""Hamburger plz"" because I thought that will help her remember the memes. She looked freaking disgusted, it became quiet and before I knew it, we arrived at her house. She opened the car door and said ""Bye thanks for the ride"" without even looking at me.

She hasn't texted me back 'til now. Am I cooked?

"TIFU. let a crackhead stay at my home for a couple days because i felt bad. he asked if a friend could stay too, i said yes. one friend turned into 14. now there’s 14 crackheads living in my house and they won’t leave. won’t call the police because i don’t want them getting arrested.
so yeah. i was just tryna be a decent human being. saw this old homeless dude outside a convenience store looking like life body slammed him, so i decided to let him crash at my place for a night. warm bed, food, maybe a shower, just something to help him feel human again.

he was super grateful at first, kept saying god sent me and all that. next day, he hits me with the “yo, my buddy just needs a place for a night too” speech. i’m thinking whatever, what’s one more?

one more turned into 2 and so on. by the third day, my house looked like a mobile shelter. people just kept showing up like it was a homeless shelter. no warning. no shame. i don’t even know who half these people are. there’s 14 of them right now.

and here’s the real kicker, they just do drugs. all day. right in front of me. like, they don’t even try to hide it. they sit on my couch while i’m watching something on the tv and smoke crack. their full on actual crackheads too it looks like my house is full of zombies

meth, crack, pills, weed, god knows what else im sitting on the couch trying to eat cereal and this dude next to me is heating up a spoon like it’s brunch time. one guy was freebasing while explaining to me why 9/11 was an inside job. another was arguing with a lamp.

one of them straight up asked me if i had any foil he could “borrow.” someone lit up a joint that smelled like motor oil and regret. i got secondhand high and paranoid from just walkin’ to my kitchen.

and the worst part? they think i’m the weird one. tried to say “yo y’all gotta leave this ain’t cool” and they looked at me like i ruined the vibe. one guy called me “uptight” for not wanting crack smoke in my bedroom.

"TIFU by over working my computer when i knew something was wrong with my PSU
...And it shorted. Won't turn on anymore. Thing is i built it myself and been working/upgrading it little by little for 5 years. Granted im not in a good place mentally. Today i was very careless playing city skylines 2 while using the map builder and planted WAY too many trees when making a map. It turned off by itself before when overworking it but this time its permanent. I'm very poor right now and Won't be building a new one anytime soon. Idk if my 4tb ssd that has my operating system in there still works.

I have been suffering a lot in the job search over the years, constantly in and out of jobs that won't keep me despite my efforts in wanting to stay.

"TIFU by misidentifying my date
So this actually happened yesterday evening, but before the fuck up is explained, I need to provide the back story 

Basically, I matched with a girl on a dating app a few weeks ago and we got on really well, and slowly but surely the conversation got a bit more flirty and then it started turning sexual, and by the time we agreed to meet up for a date, it seemed to be a case that sex was a strong possibility if everything went well during the date

The date was planned for yesterday evening and when I saw her in the distance with her back turned to me waiting at the agreed upon meeting point, in the clothes she told me she was going to wear (we told each other what we were going to be wearing for the one who saw the other first) I thought I’d try to make a good first impression. During our conversations over messages, she told me that she liked guys who were assertive and took control, so bearing that in mind, I went over and I slapped her bum to say hi (it was dumb, I know, but I thought she’d like it)

And then she turned around, and my fuck up was discovered because it wasn’t my date. It was a completely different woman! Her shock turned to anger and my confused face was turned into a pained face when she punched me in the face 

She was shouting for a guy who came running out who I presume was her boyfriend/brother etc who wanted to fight me but I was trying and failing to explain that it was the wrong girl and during this commotion my date came out from being inside and made light of the situation by confirming she was the intended target of my bum slap

"TIFU by stealing my neighbours cat
Obligatory this happened a couple days ago, but basically my wife and I started renting a new apartment in January - the previous tenant had been kicked out due to not paying rent for 6 months so when we first got to see the place there was still a bunch of the guys furniture and stuff there (he had done a runner). 
Over the last few months a cat has almost constantly been on our balcony - super friendly and always wanting attention. 
We have two young cats of our own though and they don’t get along with it (constantly fighting through closed windows) and it has also been shitting in our pot plants so it was getting kinda annoying. We started to suspect that perhaps it  belonged to the previous tenant, as it was ALWAYS outside on the balcony regardless of weather with no visible spot for it to go to the bathroom or have cover on our neighbours side.
For more context we are third story with a kinda wraparound balcony that is shared with the neighbour (who we rarely ever see at home), only a small dividing fence that the cat has no issues just walking around. It cannot access any other levels though.
We felt pretty bad for this cat as it had a slight limp and really went for food or water when we put it out.
Anyway - a few days ago I spontaneously thought stuff it and took it to the vet (conveniently right next to our building) just so we could know if it was the previous tenant or not, if it was we would take it to a shelter so it can have a proper home - otherwise I was just going to quietly put it back on the balcony and assume the neighbours must be feeding it and just a bit neglectful. My wife has bad anxiety so I didn’t want to make any issues of it - hence why I didn’t want to go over and ask, just in case it was theirs! 
I got to the vet, briefly explained the situation and the lady took the cat into a back room to check its details. 
About 5 minutes later she came out and said “yep I’ve called and confirmed it’s your neighbours cat, they are coming down to collect it now”

Well I shat myself. I asked her not to say it was me that brought the cat and asked if I could leave the cat carrier there and run home. She was cool with it but on my way up to my apartment I ran into my neighbour on the stairs and could not make eye contact. Too big of a coincidence for her to know it wasn’t me. There is no way the cat could have got to ground level or be found by anyone else. 

We haven’t seen the cat since. My wife is anxious as f and convinced the neighbours have been giving her dirty looks when she’s seen them on the street. Fml.","tried to avoid being passive aggressive towards neighbour by asking if neglected cat was theirs and so took it to nearby vet to check owners address.

"TIFU by coming home without telling my roommate.
So this did not happen today but over the weekend. On Friday, I was suppose to leave for another city to visit my family after already driving for 2 hours, I realized that I forgot the gift I got my brother back at home so I had to come back. It was around midnight when I reached back. I assumed my roommate is asleep so I could just get in and out quick without disturbing him.

  
So this is where the fuck up happened which is making me question reality and everything I thought I knew about human behaviour, hygiene and the strength of IKEA furniture.

  
I walk in, headphones on my head, keys jangling as I silently unlocked the door and casually walked into my house, only to be greeted by a sight that I thought only happens in movies.

  
There, in the middle of our shared living room, surrounded by a tangled mess of limbs, latex, and sheer audacity was my roommate. Bald, glorious, shiny, sweating like a Thanksgiving turkey in a sauna. This was one hell of a way to find out that my roommate and his partner were into swinging. I moved in 2 months ago and never thought would see this side of the my roommate. 

Now I have seen exactly zero orgies prior to this. But I know this was just elite-tier degenerate behaviour. There was a strange bare ass and balls on the table where I had my dinner last night.

  
There was music, there were snacks and masks apparently. Now we are just staring at each other, no one really knows what to do then this one guy thought it was the right time to introduce himself, I had never met Greg before and I would have preferred to meet him in a setting where his face was not between someone's thighs. And then me and my roommate made eye contact and the man just said ""Hey man, you are back early. I did not expect you until Monday"". I just nodded my head, apologized and said I forgot something, dashing into my room. I grabbed what I wanted and just got out, they had not moved from their positions, sure they had ""separated"" but were still buck naked sitting on the couch that I usually use to watch TV. I rushed out and did not look back even though I did hear my roommate say something as I was leaving.

He did apologize over the text the next morning saying ""sorry about the mess. I wish you would have texted before coming back"" but it was still quite a surreal experience. And the best part? I've still got 10 months left on the lease.

"TIFU - I Posted in an NSFW Subreddit and it Caused Someone to Ghost Me…and then Delete their Post
I saw this person make a vent post and I felt like I related to their feelings. I wanted to share my own related experience with them but I thought it would be too much personal details to comment under the post itself, so I private messaged them. I told them that I related to their feelings and asked if I could share my story/experience with them because I couldn't share it with just anyone without being called a Karen by others. At first they happily messaged back ""omg yes ofc!!!"" Only to then send a message saying never mind because they somehow thought I had a kink on the topic I wanted to talk about. That shocked me. I couldn't believe they would think that. I had made a post in an NSFW community causing my profile pic to be NSFW, and I guess they saw it and thought ill of me. I messaged them saying that it wasn't like that and that I only left my true feelings out to post in that subreddit as I thought that subreddit was most appropriate for posting it, since no other subreddits seemed appropriate, nor would accept it and would get negative backlash. I apologized if I gave them the wrong impression of me and if I made them uncomfortable, but they completely ghosted me.

Not only that, but they proceeded to delete their post in its entirety! It made me want to cry because I feel so bad that their impression of me may have made them uncomfortable enough to do that. I feel terrible about the fact that I had just caused someone to delete their whole post when I just wanted to have a chat about something I thought we could relate to! It also made me so angry and upset because they clearly judged me wrongly and formed an opinion/jumped to a conclusion, telling me I had a kink when I don’t, at least not on that level. Even if I did, I was left feeling very insecure about it. I hate making others feel uncomfortable. Now I don't think I have the heart to private message anyone anytime soon.","I private messaged someone wanting to share a story/experience with them about something I related to in their post and they declared that I had a kink and ghosted me, before deleting their post, leaving me feeling bad and insecure.","I caused someone to delete their whole post when I just wanted to have a chat about something I thought we could relate to.

Wasn’t quite today but on Monday night, my partner and I saw a dog walk past us with no human. We figured it was a lost dog and decided to search for it. We split up, my partner was on foot and I took my scooter. We don’t find the dog and met up on the corner. My partner said he was going to quickly check the park across ours quickly. I went home cause I really needed to poop.

I yelled “hey honey, did you find the dog?”  Then heard the door with no response and assumed he didn’t hear me. Yelled again and got a deep low strange noise. Heard footsteps coming up the stairs and a huge 6’2 man was standing in the doorway of the toilet as I’m taking a shit. I’m in absolute shock and then the guy says “is this the massage parlour?”. My brain is confused and then I tell him “No????”. He then asks “oh, do you offer other services here?” And again I say “uhh no????” And then he stands there for a minute confused and then walks down the stairs and leaves.

"TIFU by Stabbing My Foot on an Alexa Plug and Ending Up With Stitches Because My Cat Was Feasting Like a King
So, this glorious catastrophe unfolded last night, and I’m still limping around like I’ve got a vendetta against my own foot. Let’s set the scene: It’s late, I’m in bed with a plate of leftover pizza—greasy, perfect, pepperoni heaven. My cat, is perched nearby, giving me those “I haven’t eaten in 12 years” eyes. I know she’s full of it lmao she demolished half a can of Fancy Feast like a champ not even 30 minutes ago—but I shrug it off. My pizza, my rules. 

Wrong. So very wrong.I get up to grab my phone charger from across the room. Earlier that day, in a stroke of pure genius, I’d unplugged my Amazon Alexa to juice up my Switch instead. Did I coil the cord and stash the plug somewhere safe like a functioning human? Nope. I left it sprawled on the floor like a landmind waiting to be triggered because apparently I thrive on chaos.I plug in my phone, turn around, and—sweet mother of chaos—there’s my cat, sprawled across my bed like a furry dictator, face buried in my pizza. Sauce is smeared on her whiskers, crust crumbs are raining down, and she’s going to town like it’s her last meal on death row. 

I lose it. “NOOOO, YOU FUZZY THIEF!” I bellow, charging toward the bed to reclaim my dinner.Enter: the plot twist from hell .In my pizza-fueled fury, I don’t clock the Alexa plug lying in ambush. My bare foot slams down—FULL FORCE—right onto those evil little prongs. I’m talking over half an inch deep into the meat of my arch. The pain hits like a sledgehammer, and I crumple to the floor, shrieking a mix of profanity and gibberish that would make. I’m thrashing around, clutching my foot, while blood starts pooling like I’m auditioning for a horror movie. And My Cat? She doesn’t even pause. She glances up with this “Sucks to be you” smirk and keeps munching, like my suffering is her dinner theater.

I manage to crawl to the bathroom, leaving a trail of blood and dignity behind me. One look at the gash, and I know I’m screwed—it’s deep, it’s ugly, and it’s not stopping. So, I wrap it in a towel, hobble to my car, and drive myself to the ER, cursing my cat the whole way. The doc takes one look and goes, “Yup, stitches.”  I’m sitting there, foot numb from lidocaine, getting sewn up like a ragdoll, while the nurse asks, “How’d this happen?” I mumble something about a cat, pizza, and an Alexa plug, and she’s trying so hard not to laugh that I’m pretty sure she pulled a muscle.I finally get home, foot throbbing under a bandage, only to find my cat napping on my pillow, probably dreaming of her next culinary conquest. My pizza’s long gone, my foot’s a war zone, and I’m 90% sure theres a whole outlet on my foot now","Unplugged my Alexa, left the plug on the floor, caught my cat eating my pizza in bed, stepped on the plug in a blind rage, stabbed my foot over half an inch deep, and ended up with stitches from ER while my cat lived her best life.

"TIFU by loudly exclaiming “I’m deaf!” in front of a bunch of ASL interpreters
God I am just mortified. I was attending a conference and also helping organize, I was sitting near the back of the room and we were doing sound checks, I always find I need things to be a bit louder and I kept indicating to turn it up. Eventually they stopped turning it up because they thought it would be too loud which I then responded by saying “yes it could just be me, i’m deaf!”evidently i am a hearing person who is very much not deaf. All of the ASL interpreters whipped their heads around and I realized what I had just done. I was so mortified that I just immediately got myself busy moving chairs/avoiding everyone. This was definitely a realization about using a disability as an adjective and I certainly will not do this again in the future.

"TIFU by pretending to be my girlfriend’s dog in her DMs (don’t ask why)
Alright, so this just happened like 2 days ago and I’m still getting roasted in the group chat. Thought I’d post it here for the culture and maybe y’all can learn from my L.

So, I (20M) have been dating this amazing girl (21F) for 7 months. Let’s call her Emily. She has this little pomeranian named Mochi that she LOVES more than life itself. I’m talking matching outfits, Instagram account with 3k followers, custom dog food, the whole package.

Anyway, she’s always joking that “Mochi’s my real soulmate” and all that. Cute stuff. One night I’m bored, scrolling through her dog’s IG account (I help her run it sometimes) and I’m like… yo what if I replied to her stories pretending to be Mochi?

Just for laughs.

So I switch to the dog’s IG, reply to her latest story (it’s her in a mirror selfie) with “mommy ur glowing rn, ruff ruff.” She replies instantly like “omg stoppp that’s so cute ily baby.” So now I’m in deep. We’re full-on flirting… as a dog. I thought it was hilarious.

But here’s where I FU hard.

I forget I’m still on the dog’s account the next morning. She sends a voice note saying “you’re literally the sweetest lil fluff ever, I wish you could talk fr fr.” Me, being an actual idiot, reply with a voice note in a fake baby dog voice like “mommmyyy I luv u so muchhhhhh.”

Dead serious. Sent it.

Bro. She replies with one word:

“Aldin?”

Instant stomach drop.

Turns out… her notifications were off the whole time and she only saw all the messages after the voice note. She connected the dots in 2 seconds. She hits me with “wait… so you’ve been catfishing me as my own dog??”

I tried to play it cool like “haha it was a joke babe chill,” but she was NOT chill. She said it was giving “reverse emotional cheating” and told me to log out of Mochi’s IG permanently.

We’re not broken up, but she’s definitely weirded out now. Said she needs “a little space” to “rethink a few things.” And I haven’t gotten a good morning text since.",Pretended to be my gf’s dog in her DMs for fun. Sent a baby dog voice note. Got exposed. Now she’s questioning reality and I might be single by Sunday.,TIFU by pretending to be girlfriend’s dog in her DMs.
"TIFU, I lost my penjamin at work - I work at a school district
I smoke here & there, not a chain smoker and I don’t get slow or goofy when I do smoke. It changes my mood but I’m still sharp and able to focus (at times I focus even better). 
Sometimes, the workload is light and flowing well, so I’ll take a Penjamin break. Today I went to do that, and I couldn’t find it in my pocket. I checked my bag, everywhere around my desk, I went back to the bathroom I’d been to earlier, I even undressed myself to make sure I didn’t forget that I stuffed it somewhere, I retraced my steps since the last time I had it and nothing. 
I can’t find it and I have a strong feeling it was picked up. I’m shitting bricks, I am second in command in my department and my compensation is beyond great. This is the best job I’ve had by far and the most respectable position I’ve held at the district. 
I spoke with two others who I trust and have been here longer, they don’t think anything will come of it but I’m so worried an investigation will be pursued or something.  They think that it will be chalked up to mischievous kids or outside people that came in at some point today. 
I am always extra cautious, I constantly pat myself down to make sure it’s on me or I leave it in my purse or car. But today I chose to have it on me and did not keep checking. I fucked up by losing it, and by bringing it in the first place, knowing how much I value my job.","brought a weed pen to work (school district) and either nothing will happen, or they will somehow find out it’s mine and fire me",I lost my penjamin at work today and I’m worried it was picked up by mischievous kids.
"TIFU by trusting my old man when he said, ""get up! We're going. I know what'll make us feel better.""
I bought a fixer upper a couple years ago. It's not THAT bad but needs some love. I recently had a tree felled in my backyard in Nov and everything froze before I could get to it. Now that the weather is warming up, I finally can clean things up. It's a lot for me and I needed help. I'm 40 and my old man is... 65? I dunno, 60's. We spent HOURS working on the tree and were exhausted by the end of the afternoon. We laid around the couch and my dad was just playing on his phone and he slapped his hands on his legs and looked over at me and said, ""get up! We're going. I know what'll make us feel better.""

We hopped into my truck and he said he, ""found a place,"" and he'd direct me where to go. I thought since it was so late, we were going to get some food or a drink. My dad is boujee and he'll pay good money for booze and food, so I wasn't gonna object. He had plugged the directions into his phone's GPS and was telling me where to go. When we arrived, it was some sorta small Asian strip mall, not unsurprising as Japanese food is our favorite. We walked up and I started veering left, assumedly to the restaurant and he goes, ""YO,"" and gestures right... To an Asian massage parlor, ""my treat.""

Internally I started panicking. I don't get massages, I never know what the protocol is and it gets me anxious. My 'tism kicks in and I can't relax, choosing to focus on odd things like, ""I hope they wash the table, what if some gross person was here last, did they wash their hands, etc."" I become one big knot and rather than say anything when people work on me, I clam up and just let them dig away and muffle my pain in the face rest. Plus... I don't know what the clothing rules are, it's always different... If I ever do get a massage, I have to hype myself up mentally for it and I ONLY ever do 30 mins. I'm weird, I know.

We walked in and a mama-san came out and my dad told them two for a 1 hour massage. Now I'm more panicked as I've only ever done 30 mins. We separate to different rooms and the mama-san tells me to get naked and sit. Slightly better, as I now know I'm SUPPOSED to be naked but still anxious as fuck. In walks this attractive Asian lady and she makes the room darker and there just red candles and music and incense burning. She tells me to lay down on the table on my stomach and unwrap the towel so it's laying across my butt. She starts her routine and tells me I'm a giant knot and to relax. I explained my feelings and she giggled but just nicely ended up talking to me to get me to relax. Not conversations but explaining what she was going to do before she did it. 

That ended up being very helpful, as she warned me when she was going to touch me and what to expect. I actually did end up relaxing for once in my life and she could tell. After 30 mins, she told me to roll over onto my back and picked the towel up off me to do so. She told me to just relax and turn over and ""it was just skin, nothing she hasn't seen before."" I didn't think anything of it and rolled over and she gasped and said, ""oh my! Your wife is a lucky lady!""

I was unaware I had a massive erection. I immediately panicked and turned into a giant knot again and she covered me slower than I expected but the damage was done. It was hard for me to remain relaxed, except for groin apparently and she sorta kept giggling as she had to go around it or watched it just wave like a metronome at her under the towel, as she shimmied my thighs and legs around. She apologized for giggling and assured me it wasn't like AT me but the situation. I couldn't relax and it just made me tense up more, so it felt like a waste of time and money.

We left and I was a bit mortified and told my wife and she nearly peed her pants laughing.

TL:DR I unknowingly went to a massage parlor with my old man and ended up with a massive erection the masseuse had a hard time working around.",,My dad took me to a massage parlor and I freaked out.
"TIFU ask my boss for a meeting and had a breakdown
TIFU - A couple of hours ago I asked my manager for Teams call. Im currently signed off sick with stress and anxiety. I’d had a bit if work I’d been dealing with for over 6 months and it was due to come to a conclusion this week, so I thought I would check in. Turns out after I was signed off my boss reviewed the work and disagreed with an element, so pulled it. 

Mind I hadn’t been working it alone, and others in my Team had confirmed that the evidence I had was clear. 

I asked her for a meeting to discuss, but i was so upset I ended up telling her that i had felt singled out for a while by her, that I felt she had a preference for others in the team and that she had made this obvious (this has also been witnessed and commented on by others) that I had thought I was good at my job and fit well in with the team, but was now worried that was not the case. 

I guess I was looking for some reassurance, why I thought I would get it from someone who was making me feel that way in the first place I don’t know. Well, didn’t happen! Basically was told id made things harder for her and the team by being signed off, that she didn’t know what to say in response to the issues raised and acknowledged that we used to have a much better/closer working relationship than we do now, but she has put that down to the team expanding. She also said that making allowances for my disability had meant she had had to defend herself against criticism from others who had queried and that these adjustments made other people feel I am preferred over them.  

All in all, felt like a fucking muppet acting as i did (I was crying and i was upset as I have been hurt about how she has been treating me). I now know she knows how I am feeling but also know she isn’t going to do anything about it and thinks I’m a Moron and have probably made things 10x harder for myself going back.",Asked for a meeting with my Boss looking for clarity and reassurance and made a proper tit of myself.,"I asked my boss for a meeting, she said I was singled out for a while and that she didn’t know what to say in response to the issues raised."
"TIFU: Not really just  today but after not sleeping for ~49hr I passed out and woke up ~3hr later for school…
So basically in order to understand what’s happening I have to give a brief description of why I can’t sleep. Essentially I’m on medications at night to stay sane and also to sleep, but because of how much weight you gain from them, I stopped taking them. Stupid idea but I figured I’d just deal with it and loose as much weight as possible but I definitely won’t be able to keep going. I might not be tired but my body is hence why I passed out (I think). I’ve been seeing/hearing things and it’s progressively and rapidly getting worse. I’ve been hearing my friends/family say things that they didn’t, I’ve been seeing demons and at first I could ignore them because Im aware that they’re fake but I’m guessing that the whole delusional parts coming with it. I can’t think like anything and havent been able to do like anything at all. My entire body and mind is hurting so bad. Idk if I want to continue because I do want to loose weight but this isn’t healthy. Idk

SUMMARY (",")

I’m crazy so I take medication to not be crazy. One effect of it is sleep since I have problems sleeping. But sadly another effect is weight gain which I didn’t want so I stopped taking them and then I couldn’t sleep and I’m loosing my mind. I plan on stopping but I can’t tell anyone else but strangers. Might triple my dose because holy FUCK I’m loosing it.",I can’t sleep because of how much weight I gain from taking meds and I’m losing weight.
"TIFU by strangling my nuts
So I'm a relatively frugal guy, and underwear is oddly one of those things. I had one pair where it was developing a hole right in the nether region and I joked with my wife about taking a dump through it one day.

Well, that one day finally came, but it wasn't for a dump. My nuts slipped through and I sat down. I let out a high pitched squeal and wife asked me what happened. I said I sat on my nuts. Being the wise crack she is, she asked why I never did that before, since I've had them my whole life.

I then told her it was because of my underwear, and then I showed her that night. She just laughed in my face.

"TIFU by projecting my past drug use onto my wife’s autism
(Obligatory “this happened over the past few months, but the full realization just hit me, so I guess that counts, right?” disclaimer.)
So… TIFU by being an absolute moron and thinking my wife was a junkie. Yeah, I’m that guy.
A bit of backstory: In my foolish youth, I had a not-so-little fling with cocaine. Not my proudest moment, but hey, at least I learned how to spot coked-up behavior from a mile away. Fast-forward a decade, I’m happily married to my lovely wife, who has ADHD. She’s been on Concerta for a while (like, medically prescribed by a psychiatrist and everything). But thanks to my old party brain, I was certain her ADHD meds were making her behave as if she was hopped up on cocaine.
Her “cocaine-like” behavior? She’d talk nonstop about her new favorite subject until my ears actually considered running away from my head. She’d get super fixated on politics, activism, and feminism for hours, do these weird little repetitive movements with her hands, and sometimes come across as just plain blunt. You know, like someone who forgot their social filters at home. I was so sure she was abusing her meds in secret, I half-expected to see her snorting lines off the coffee table.  

But did I ask her directly like a normal human being? Noooo. Of course not. Because obviously, she was going to rip my head off for accusing her of being a druggie. So instead, I decided to create this weird, paranoid dynamic where I was always side-eyeing her as she happily took her prescribed medication. Every time she’d do some “strange” stuff—like rocking back and forth, or talking with a monotone voice about the intersectionality of modern feminist theory for three hours (suddenly, feminism was the epicenter of her universe; I know more about third-wave feminist discourse than I do about my own mother)—I’d just assume, “Welp, that’s the coke talking.”  

These “coke suspicion” vibes turned me into a massive jerk. I’d snap at her for being rude, or I’d avoid conversation because I didn’t want to feed her mania (I’m an idiot, I know). We started having fights that sounded totally insane from her perspective:  

Her: “Why are you so dismissive every time I’m telling you about how activism strategies evolved in the ‘70s?!” Me: “Because I’m not sure you’re even… sober right now?”  

Spoiler: She was always sober—like, literally on the correct dosage of an FDA-approved medication. My efforts to “contain the crisis” were basically me being a colossal a-hole.  

Eventually, the fights got so bad that she brought them up to her psychiatrist. Cue the biggest TIFU: the doctor runs an evaluation and goes, “Hmm… you might be autistic.” Turns out her ADHD meds were tamping down the ADHD symptoms, which left her autistic traits more obvious than ever. So her “stimmy” hand movements, intense monologues about niche topics (like the historical shifts in feminism, or the intricacies of different activist movements), abrupt bluntness, and total disregard for standard small-talk-lingua were textbook autism signs.  

In the end, she got an official autism diagnosis! Now, instead of being a junkie, she’s… just autistic. I’d basically spent months writing a paranoid mental fanfic about my wife as this secret coke fiend, all because I recognized “signs” from my own past drug use. Meanwhile, she just had a combination of conditions that made her appear super intense and occasionally socially clueless.
To top it off, she insisted I write this exact post as an apology on her behalf (well, more like an apology to her, but she requested Reddit see it for comedic justice). So yeah, dear wife, I’m sorry for:  

* Every time I gave you a suspicious glare while you popped your perfectly legal, much-needed meds.  

* Every conversation I walked away from because I was worried you were “tweaked” when really you just really love talking about political activism and feminist theory.  

* Every meltdown I caused by implying you were coked out when you were just having a meltdown… or maybe meltdown is the wrong word. Neurospicy meltdown?  

I messed up big time. Please accept my wife’s new special interest in endless monologues about crocheted cat sweaters as a peace offering, because apparently that’s next on the hyperfocus list. And yes, I promise from now on, I’ll ask honest, caring questions before deciding the love of my life is hopped up on illicit substances.","TIFU by thinking my wife was abusing her ADHD meds because she acted “coked up.” After nearly destroying our marriage with my secret suspicions, we found out she’s actually autistic. Now I’m the jerk who has to apologize to the internet for being a paranoid idiot. She is very much not a druggie—just an autistic ADHDer who really likes talking about politics, activism, and feminism (and apparently crocheted cat sweaters). Sorry, babe. I owe you more than one.",TIFU by projecting my past drug use onto my wife's autism.
"TIFU by trying to clear ice and accidentally ending up on my neighborhood Facebook group
There is a huge block of ice blocking the drain that drains water from the road. Because of this, water has been gathering in a big puddle on the road, and creating a growing pothole visible under the water. On the colder days, it freezes and makes the road slippery. People have called the city about this, and nothing gets done. The city workers don't operate in this area. Anyways, after slipping on this ice for what seems like the hundredth time during my daily commute, I decided to take matters into my own hands.

When I made it home, I grabbed a snow shovel and started breaking the ice to free the drain. The ice was really stubborn and I couldn't see the drain, but I knew that it was there. After a few hours, I decided to call it a day. The next day, I used a saw to saw the ice. Still, it didn't budge. Then I used a pickaxe on the ice. It worked better than the shovel. Still, I couldn't completely break through the metre of ice. I decided to put more road salt on it in a last attempt. After that, I went back inside.

I checked my Facebook and there was a post on the community group that said “Whoever is the parent of that kid breaking the ice, please get your kid, they are blocking the road.”

Where I live, nobody wants to splash a kid with road water, because it is like the bare minimum of what you can get sued for. So nobody wanted to drive by too fast. They all drove slowly to avoid splashing what they thought was somebody's kid. I told the original poster that it was my kid, and asked them to take the picture down. They did take the picture down. I knew I was short, but I didn't know that I was that short.","Tried to clear ice off a drain near the road, ended up mildly inconveniencing others.

"TIFU by not checking a memory montage video I sent to family
I sent this video last weekend and am only realizing the FU now. I went on a trip to ME with my family last year (Mom, Aunts, Uncles, Cousins from Ireland my mother’s age) and took lots of photos. It came up on my phone memories and I decided to post it in a family group chat. 

The problem is I live in a state where “jazz cabbage” is illegal and it’s legal in ME so of course I had to get some for the sake of saying I smoked in ME.

"TIFU and accidentally gave my girlfriend a black eye while sleeping.
This happened exactly 3 hours and 3 minutes ago. I have not slept, and I feel terrible. Here's the story.

I've never been known for being a great sleeper. Usually 5-6 restless hours is plenty, and I dream constantly. As a result, sometimes an event in a dream (trip/fall, scary scenario, etc) will make me jolt awake and physically flail a bit. This is something that I know to be normal amongst many people, and I have always worried and that one day I might accidentally flail in the wrong direction and catch my girlfriend in the head with a forearm or an accidental kick to the leg. For this reason, I normally try to sleep on my back or face away, but obviously not 100% consistent.

Well it finally happened in the worst way possible. This was the first time ever I woke up with a physical punch. The dream was involving some sort of thief. After the room, full of people figured out that this was the person in question who everyone was looking for, who had stolen a camera and some papers, I found myself near said thief. So what'd I do? I reared back and clocked him (in the dream, he was in front of me facing away and the punch landed in the ribs/side.

Cue the five seconds of terror that now feel like an eternity after only one. I wake up to realize that punch connected square in my girlfriend's eye. Still in a stupor, I just start babbling ""oh my god baby, baby baby. Oh my God I'm so sorry. Oh my god I swear that was an accident. Baby...it's okay, oh my God I'm so sorry...etc""

That was 4am. After getting an ice pack and taking care for a bit, obviously I went to sit on the couch in a different room, praying that maybe it wasn't too bad. She woke up with a nice shiner with about 30 minutes before her work at a very socially interactive job including many young kids and is understandably upset about the notion of having to explain what happened all day. We also will travel to visit her parents and grandparents on Friday. I fucked up...

Because I know it will come up in the comments, no, this has nothing to do with domestic abuse (other than her, unfortunately having to explain to other that it is indeed not). We are very happy together. And I would never lay a violent hand on anyone on Earth, let alone the love of my life.",Spazzed during a dream and punched my girlfriend in the eye upon waking.,I accidentally gave my girlfriend a black eye while sleeping.
"TIFU by eating dodgy olives 4 hours before leaving for my flight home
Writing this from the toilet. I was on holiday in Portugal for the last week and my Uber for the airport leaves in about 20 minutes and it kind of stresses me out. The flight is only gonna be three hours, so I hope it will be manageable.

The olives have been open for a few days but last night I thought it would be a waste to leave them here and a good idea to have them before going to bed. They were still delicious though.

2nd FU(was technically before and is worsening my real FU): I was surfing on Tuesday and now I have some real muscle aches in my abdomen.

3rd FU: I had some spicy Korean Fried Cauliflower last night as dinner and it really hurts.

"TIFU by putting trash where it was not supposed to go.
I’m on mobile.

Let me start this out by saying that I am completely aware of how stupid I can be. I am book smart, not street smart. It is a genuine problem for me sometimes. This story happened yesterday at In&Out. My mom and I went to go get animal style fries because they’re really good, and we sat down inside to eat. We usually don’t do this at In&Out, so I don’t really know the layout of the restaurant that well. (This is important to the story). We finish our food and my mom goes out to the car to start it like and I get up to throw away the trash like we usually do when we eat out. I walk to the little area that has condiments and banana peppers because in my brain, it makes sense that there would be a trash can there. This is where I messed up. There was a square hole that was silver inside and looked like there was a bag. I assumed that this was the trash can and put all of the trash in there. I got a look from another customer, but I’m not all that socially aware so I didn’t pay any attention to it. I only realized that I messed up when a worker came over to replace the container of peppers. She stopped, saw the trash, and it looked like that was her thirteen reason. I immediately realized what I did. She started to clean it and I immediately apologized, extremely embarrassed. What makes this worse is that I had grabbed peppers from there before my mom and I sat down to eat, so I absolutely should have known that it was not a trash can. If you are that poor lady that had to deal with my stupidity, trust me when I say that I am mortified and will be thinking about this until the day I die.",I finished my food at In&Out and threw away my trash in where the banana pepper containers are supposed to go.,TIFU by putting trash where it was not supposed to go.
"TIFU by requesting my childhood CPS reports
I (29F)  recently had a few new diagnosis, due to new findings and tests. I recently started putting together some things from my childhood and my brother mentioned something about a CPS case when we were kids. (I don't remember 90% of my life before 12 yrs old) I ended up requesting the records from the local department and today they emailed me back saying it is estimated to take 14 hours of labor to copy and redact everything and will cost me around $350 to receive the copies. I've requested records before on a different matter and received everything almost instantly and for free, but it was only about 20-30 pages total. What did I get myself into?! Now I have to decide if I want to try to save the money to pay for it or let it go.

"TIFU by reacting poorly when a female rejected me
So a few weeks ago I asked a female at my university out on a date to hang out by a river, and she declined saying she had a boyfriend. This made me extremely angry so last night I decided to take revenge.

I got really drunk on my own and stalked her Facebook, whereupon I found a photo of her dead father (he was a firefighter who died on the job last year). So I printed out the photo and did a huge poo on it.

Then I went to her dorm and left the photo outside of her door for her to see when she wakes up.

I’m now worried she’ll find out it’s me and that I’ll get into trouble. I’ve already been in trouble for spitting on a female and sneezing in a female’s hair, and I’m worried this may be the final straw.","I got really drunk and did a poo on a photo of a female’s dead father because she rejected me, I then left the photo outside her dorm room.",TIFU by taking a photo of a dead father.
"TIFU by not double checking my email
Background: I have a 10 month old baby, a husky and work pretty much every weekend, so my weekdays are stressful since I CANNOT miss a day of studies or I fall behind.

I am currently studying and for the last 6 months of the education we need to do an internship. I had applied to 10 companies or more without success until I suddenly got an answer from a company I applied late to (intern application period had closed). They asked for my résumé and so and eventually asked when I could meet to discuss further details. That was today. I went and to my surprise, they had no idea what I was doing there. When I got home about an hour ago I checked the email. It was another company that had sent me the date.

"TIFU by thinking I had testicular torsion
This was actually a few months ago. I was walking back from the pharmacy with my prescription, and I noticed my balls were really starting to hurt, with each step making it worse until I could barely walk. I went back to my apartment and lightly tapped my balls. Shooting pain. I thought I had testicular torsion so I walked to the nearby urgent care and explained that I thought I had testicular torsion. 

In between the first nurse seeing me and the second nurse that was going to examine my balls, they miraculously stopped hurting. Entirely. But it was too late. The nurse came in (she was cute, which made it worse) and I had to explain that I wasn't a pervert but my balls did, in fact, stop hurting. She still had to examine them. 

What I found out happened, according to her, is that my testicle somehow inverted itself and then flipped back. The look on my face when I realized that was a thing that could happen....",nurse had to examine my balls even though there was nothing wrong with them,I thought I had testicular torsion.
"TIFU by having to make my friend call the presidents secretary to get her tourist visa.
This is actually a thing I did in 2019 and only remembered recently after talking to my friend.

The year is 2019, myself(22f) and friends were preparing to go from the UK to universal Orlando, Florida. We wrote out our visas 2 months before going.

However! I was filling out my friends visa form, she didn't have strong, stable internet at the time. Talking to her over the phone while filling it out. She is disabled, so when we got to a section asking if she was disabled as a result of... list various reasons, to which I automatically put YES and moving on. Turns out instead of ticking the box for general disabilities, as I did for a visa we filled out a few years before. I ticked an option to say she was disabled as a result of ebola.

A month later we get our responses back. Hers was not approved. We freaked out, she was furious at me and filled out the form again herself. She got to a part asking if she was denied a visa before and said yes, and was denied again.

Stress rising 3 weeks before we were flying out. She tried to call the uk visa and immigration, who transferred her the London us embassy to try and get help and clear this mess up. Turns out they where under renovations and the department she needed was closed for another 2 months. They transferred her across the sea to their state side office.

State side said they could not help her, as it was either beneath them, not their problem or they did not have access after 4 hours she was handed over to the presidents secretary. This woman was angry and annoyed but took the time to listen to my friend, in tears at this point, and was infuriated with her over the process she had to get this error sorted. 

After clearing my friends strikes and filling out the visa for her she told her that she would get a response by the end of the day. If it still failed then to call again and if she gets to her again she would approve it herself overwise she would need a presidential pardon to get in to the states. 

Her visa was approved thankfully and I didn't lose a friendship.","accidently messed up my friends tourist visa, making her have to call the us embassy getting passed all the way up to the presidents secretary to gain it.

"TIFU by throwing away a child's teddy bear and having to dumpster dive
I work at a daycare. Yesterday we were cleaning up after closing and one of the moms came back and said her toddler son brought a stuffed animal but didn't come with it. They're not really supposed to bring their own toys but of course my supervisor asks us to look for it. And I realize I actually saw the bear but I assumed it was the center's, and because of safety part of our cleanup routine is to toss toys if they're worn out.. so you see where this is going. It was really bad timing, we literally just brought bags to the dumpster.

She *not* happy and pretty much insisted we go look for it anyway. I felt bad for her but that was too much.

"TIFU Don’t online cross border shop with a flu at 1 am
 I made a pretty expensive mistake today. In my tired, sick state half awake and definitely not thinking straight I went ahead and placed an order for some hobby items I’d been eyeing. That wouldn’t normally be a problem, except I completely forgot that the store I ordered from is based in the US. It’s one of the usual shops I browse, so muscle memory took over, and I checked out without even thinking

That small oversight is going to cost me more than I’d like. Because it’s an US based store, I now have to deal with the CAD and USD being horrible for exchange rate. Then there’s the 25% tariff on the orders. And let’s not forget the standard taxes and fees when the package hits the border.
But on the bright side, I will have two new WWII era battleships to build, and a few new Gundam kits to add to the collection.

What makes this even more frustrating is that this isn’t the first time I’ve made a questionable financial decision while sick.

"TIFU telling my gf I had stomach cramps
A few nights ago my gf and I experimented with a roleplay idea she cooked up while watching a medical drama. She wanted me to play the patient while she played the doctor examining me. Since it all happened in our bedroom, sex was obviously the prime objective for both of us. My gf gave me full creative control to be as sick or injured as I wanted to be. I decided to go with stomach cramps. My gf, who was now dressed like the doctors she watched on tv, instructed me to take off my shirt and lie down on the bed. She pressed her fingers on my stomach and asked if I was feeling any pain. I said no, which prompted my gf to press harder, forcing me to change my answer to yes. My gf asked if my poop was dark or black perhaps. I broke character and asked why the fuck were we talking about the colour of my shit.

My gf, who was still in character, insisted that I answer her question. I said my poop was as dark as my soul. My gf put on her latex gloves and instructed me to switch to the face down ass up position. As soon as I did that, my gf pulled down my pants and instructed me to relax. When I asked what was happening, she said she had to put her finger inside my butt. I was about to leap off the bed, but my gf literally kissed my ass and insisted that I allow her to do her job. I never had anything penetrate my ass before until that moment. My gf was gentle, but her lubricated finger felt like a torpedo entering my virgin butthole. I repeatedly shouted at my gf that she was making me shit while she repeatedly used medical jargon to explain to me that anal penetration usually felt like shitting. 

I said I wanted her to stop talking to me like she was really a doctor, and please tell me, partner to partner, if I actually was pooping or not because I was fully convinced that I definitely was fucking pooping. My gf eventually pulled out her finger and removed her gloves. I switched from face down ass up to face up feet on the floor. There was no poop when I looked. My gf, who was somehow still in character, diagnosed me with a rare stomach condition and said I had less than 3 days to live, so I should probably have sex with her before it was too late to have sex with anyone. If I knew I was gonna get finger fucked in the butt because of fake stomach cramps, I would've gone with a headache. At least I now know my gf suffers from an acute case of crazy.

"TIFU by telling my boyfriend I have a crush on my coworker
I genuinely think he’s gonna break up with me. I (20F) told my boyfriend (21M) that I have a crush on my coworker (19M). Let me explain myself. I’ve been working with my coworker, Joseph (fake name), for 2 months now. He’s nice and all. He fits the stereotypical guy I go after. But, he isn’t my boyfriend. My boyfriend is kind, selfless, caring, intelligent, hard-working, patient, forgiving, and loves me for who I am. I’m a mess. I have multiple mental health issues and so much trauma from previous relationships. John (fake name) is the love of my life. We’re coming up on a year together and I’ve never loved someone like this. Three days ago I noticed I had slight feelings towards Joseph and I felt extremely guilty. I researched online and saw that it’s normal to have small crushes on people even though you’re in a relationship. Everything told me to be open and honest with my partner about it. So, I decided to talk to him about it. I can tell he’s upset with me. He said “I don’t know what you want me to do with this information,” and “I would just like to think about it and reach my own conclusion to how I feel about this.” I’m terrified of what he’ll say. 

I can’t envision life without him. He’s everything to me. I want to marry him and have a future with him. I constantly tell him how much I want to take him to the courthouse and marry him so I can call him my husband. That isn’t all just talk. I’m not saying that just to say that. I wholeheartedly love this man— sometimes it scares me how much I love him and what I’d do for him. I don’t want him to feel more insecure than he already is. To paraphrase him, he’s “balding and out of shape.” I don’t care that he’s balding, I think his shaved head is adorable. I don’t care that he’s starting to get out of shape, I fell in love with him— not his body. 

I’m terrified that he’ll break up with me. I just did what I thought was best. I’m not more attracted to Joseph than I am with John. I’ve always done my best in our relationship to give him as much affirmation as I can. He genuinely believes I’m way out of his league and “doesn’t understand why [I’m] dating him.” I don’t see it at all. And even if I am out of his league, who cares? I love him for him, not for his looks. I fell in love with how much care he holds me with - both physically and metaphorically - how he goes out of his way to understand me, how he doesn’t care that I’m fucked up. I love him for him. I don’t know if he believes that anymore. He told me he understood where I was coming from, that I didn’t need to apologise for saying what I did, and that he’s not going to leave me. But I genuinely feel like he should. I don’t deserve him, his patience, or his forgiveness. I never should’ve told him what I did. I should’ve kept it to myself and stirred in my shame. 

I’d never leave John for anyone— let alone Joseph. He’s fine, I guess. Like I said, he’s just stereotypically my type. Dark hair and eyes, tall, funny, and kind of ugly. John has blonde hair, green eyes, is funny, and is the most handsome person I’ve ever met. I got interested because of his looks and how well we bounced off of one another, and fell in love with him for him. I don’t know if he believes me when I say that. I don’t want him to doubt my love for him— I just wanted to be honest. I’m autistic and don’t know social norms and what’s normal and not normal to say. I grew up in a household where you always have to tell the truth, even if it hurts you or the person you’re telling it to. Guys, I fucked up so bad and now I don’t know what to do.","I told my boyfriend I have a slight crush on my coworker and now he’s probably gonna break up with me, even though I would never leave my boyfriend for my coworker",I told my boyfriend I have a crush on my coworker.

"TIFU by literally forgetting my damn exam
This happened in late march, so not too long ago as of posting and I'm still so incredibly frustrated and mad at myself that I let this happen. I study a creative field at a university and our exams are all hand-ins online. For my Art class, we had to hand in a portfolio of stuff we've drawn over the semester and a few other specialized projects like a storyboard for example.

The website we use to deliver our exams said the deadline for this Art exam was on friday the 21st of march at 2pm. Every student in the class knew this, including me. My entire project is done and ready to be handed in, and I just need to wait until the few days before the deadline when the exam opens for deliveries. So I do. I wait until a couple days before the deadline, finished project sitting in my hard drive. The exam opens, but I'm busy with family stuff and another class at the time, so I put off the delivery. By the end of the day, I'm tired and I think ""It doesn't matter if I wait, I'll just do it tomorrow.""

Tomorrow comes and I, yet again, don't deliver it due to a combination of being busy and procrastinating. I think the same thing as I did the night before, except I had also made plans to meet up with people from my class to watch a movie with them in the uni building later that night of the deadline-day. Since I had managed to sleep past a meet-up time before, I focused up and made sure I didn't this time, consuming most of my attention and thought into that.

So I wake up the next day, exam completely gone from my mind as I do what I need to do that day before getting ready to leave to go to the watchparty. When I get there, I look at the time on my phone and see the date as well. That jolts my memory up to speed and makes me think about the exam again. The deadline was at 2pm, and the time was 6pm.

I damn near had a heart attack before emailing my professor explaining the situation and asking what could be done. He told me to email the counsellor, which I did, and he said I should retake the subject next semester. Then, I had to sit through a watchparty with students from my class who no longer had to worry about that exam, while I was incredibly frustrated and angry with myself for letting this happen. That's not even considering the shame and embarrassment I'd feel if any of them knew what had happened. I still haven't told anyone, and I'm not sure when I will...","I procrastinated delivering my exam until the day of the deadline, then promptly forgot about it until it was too late, and now I need to retake the subject.

"TIFU by destroying my cooler
So basically, I, live in a South Asian country where it's VERY HOT right now. Summers are the absolute worst for me personally cause it feels like my entire room is a steamer. I don't know if it's the insulation or something else but for some reason, my room ESPECIALLY gets very hot in the summers, compared to the rest of the house, which is unbearable sometimes. 
Last night I moved stuff around in my room to use the old cooler we have. (It's not common for a lot of people to have air conditioners and honestly that would be very expensive so we just use coolers that you fill up with water and then it dispenses cool air when plugged in) 
It worked fine overnight and then this evening I thought instead of taking a bucket and mug to fill it up, I'll just use a pipe/hose to fill water inside it. So I did. It worked for a while but later when I tried to switch it back on, it started making weird noises and suddenly stopped working. 
I feel like it mightve been some voltage issue at the point where I plugged it in or I may have accidentally damaged some internal parts when I inserted the pipe inside to fill the water. 
It's too expensive to repair or get a new one and I basically have to suffer through the heat for the rest of the summer.

"TIFU by telling my professor I was “gravely ill” when I just had a cold
So I (bilingual, born and raised in Germany) emailed a professor to let him know I wouldn’t be attending his seminar because I was sick. I’ve never met this professor in person and won’t ever have him again, it was just one seminar.
Anyway, being bilingual and flipping between my native language and German all the time, I wrote something along the lines of “ich bin leider schwer erkrankt”, thinking that just meant “I’m pretty sick” or “feeling rough.” I didn’t realize until two weeks later that “schwer erkrankt” in German doesn’t just mean “sick,” it actually implies something way more serious, like gravely or seriously ill. Think hospital-level.
Now I’m spiraling a little wondering if the prof thinks I lied. I didn’t hear back from him at all. No reply, no concern, no “get well soon” — just silence. And now I’m sitting here wondering if I accidentally told this man I was on death’s door… and then just ghosted.
I also had a moment of panic thinking, “wait… can a professor in Germany make me get thrown out of Uni for lying??” even tho I didn’t intent to lie.","I told my prof I was “gravely ill” in German when I just had a cold, didn’t realize until 2 weeks later, and now I’m overthinking if he thinks I lied","Told a professor I was “gravely ill” when I just had a cold.

"TIFU by thinking my friend was joking about needing space
So, a few months ago, my best friend, who I’ve known for years, told me that she needed space because she was going through a lot personally and just needed to focus on herself for a while. I thought she was just being dramatic, honestly. I mean, we always joked around and had a pretty relaxed friendship, so I assumed she was just over-exaggerating or trying to get out of hanging out. So, instead of respecting her space, I kept texting her, checking in, and trying to make her laugh. I even showed up at her house unannounced, thinking it would cheer her up. She never really told me directly that I was crossing a line, but I could feel the distance growing, and eventually, she stopped replying altogether. It wasn’t until much later that she explained how much I hurt her, how I was pushing her boundaries, and that my insistence on being around made her feel suffocated.

I feel like I completely ruined what was one of the most important relationships in my life. She’s still kind of distant, and I can’t stop kicking myself for not understanding what she was going through. I guess I thought because we were so close, she wouldn’t mind me “being there” for her, but I see now how I completely missed the point. I don't even know how to make it right.","I ignored my friend's request for space, kept pushing her to hang out, and ended up ruining our friendship.

"TIFU by not telling my girlfriend her curls are pretty
My now girlfriend and I met at 16, but didn't start dating until much later. I never noticed anything unusual about her hair, until one day, a few years before we started dating, she confessed that I had never actually seen her natural hair. Said her hair was really wavy but that she always straightened it for me because she liked me, and that's how she felt pretty 

Fast forward to today, we've been dating for 2 years, during which she has permanently straightened her hair. Recently, she ""embarked on a journey"" of wearing her natural hair out because she was sick of the straightener. She has been insufferable since. She keeps fidgeting with her wet hair, asking if it looks good, or running off to the bathroom 2 or 3 times in an hour while we're out, only to check on her hair. She also does this thing where she'll find odd-looking curls and show them to me. ""Babe, look, this one is REALLY curly"". That happens at least once or twice every day.

 I don't care how she wears her hair, but I was getting annoyed by her making such a big deal out of it and taking an hour of my time every day only to bring attention to her hair . Well,l today, when she tried to show me a curl for the 20th time, I snapped. "" I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR GODDAMN HAIR. WEAR IT HOWEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT, JUST PLEASE STOP TRYING TO MAKE IT MY BUSINESS, IT'S LIKE YOU'RE OBSSESED. IT'S JUST HAIR"" 

As the words came out of my mouth, I saw her look at me with the most hurt look I'd ever seen on her face. She says, ""I just wanted you to tell me my curls were pretty so I'd feel good about wearing them out"". And then it hit me: not once had I told her that her natural hair looks good on her. She had been so clingy about it the whole week because she was fishing for a reassuring compliment from her boyfriend. She then explained that's the way her hair grows out of her head, and that she'd like to know that I like her even when she puts no effort into her appearance. Of course I apologised, but I still feel like the biggest asshole on the planet.","I snapped at my girlfriend for being too annoying about her hair, when all she wanted was for me to tell her she looked pretty with her natural curls","I told my girlfriend that her natural hair looks good on her, but she was so clingy about it the whole week that I told her that I didn't care about her hair."
"TIFU by returning bras at the Post Office
This happened about an hour ago, when I popped to the Post Office on my lunch break to return three bras I'd ordered from Amazon.

I didn't realise it was a 'packing and return' service and I'd already packaged the three bras in one bag. Guy behind the counter asks what they are and I just say clothing items. He scans my QR code using his phone and the bras show up on the screen, complete with lovely, half-naked models. I shrug to myself, ok they're only bras.

Then he tells me they need to be in three separate bags. Also hadn't anticipated this. So after struggling to open the bag I'd meticulously wrapped, I have to ask to use his scissors, then I hand him the first bra. Haha, ok slightly awkward but let's move on. 

Then he asks for the second bra but the picture on his phone just shows a black bra (also with a lovely, half-naked model) but the two remaining bras are both black and I can't figure out which one it is. He shows me the description on his phone again: 34DD, please. 

With the queue growing, the guy's dad opens the next till across (it's a family-run Post Office) and I'm dimly aware of an audience. I scramble to find the size on the bra. It's not on the first label. Second label? How many fucking labels does a bra need? I hold the bra up to the light to see, ah yes, this one is 34DD. Rapidly-but-pretend-casually hand him second bra. He rapidly-but-pretend-casually packages it up. I'm conscious at this point that he's holding something that's been against my boobs. We lock eyes. He knows this too. 

Third bra we get over with as quickly as possible. Do I need a receipt? Guy won't even look at me now, no no, he tells the floor, Amazon will email you.

"TIFU by letting my friend's kid watch basketball videos on my phone
A long time friend of mine is going through a separation and is moving back in with his parents this week, and since I didn't have work today, I went over to help him with packing up some stuff and taking it to his parents house.

His son was very energetic about the goings on, and I figured that while we were working, I could let his kid watch YouTube on my phone as a distraction.

"TIFU by not canceling my LinkedIn premium on time
So so so for context I am a 23 year old girl living in India with my desi Indian parents in Gurgaon.

While he was on call, I was casually browsing LinkedIn and I realised I had set up an auto payment from his card -as the details were saved on my laptop.

"TIFU by leaving my Google account logged in on a work computer.
TL:DR

Hello Reddit, I am a 26 yr old gay man. So to clarify, this happened to me a few years ago when I was 21. At the time I was working 2nd Shift at a label factory where we printed and encoded labels that had RFID chips inside. One day I was running this order that was time consuming and practically ran itself. All I had to do was randomly remove a label scan it on the computer to make sure it was encoding properly. It took about an hour an a half for a full roll of labels to get done. 

So what had happen was while the machine ran as slow as molasses, I got bored. So I opened up a Google incognito window and logged into my Google docs and continued to write my fallout fan fiction. My shift was 10 hours so I got plenty done. By the time I got home I only then realized I left the incognito window open on my Google doc. I didn't think much of it and just figured the next person would just close the window and that was that. Boy I had too much faith in people.

I went into work the next day and immediately I was called to my boss's office. So I walked in and there was my boss and the warehouse manager. He asked me to close the door and said ""So someone from first shift brought this to our attention."" He gestured to the laptop that I used the previous evening and told me to open it up. 
So the thing is, at the time I didn't know Google had a feature where it would upload any and ALL photos you took with your phone to your Google drive. So when I opened the laptop, there I was. Pole and hole. 

The scream that I screampt.

I immediately was in tears thinking I was gonna get fired (I've never been fired before). My boss told me I could take a minute so I ran to the bathroom. I was so distraught. After I collected myself I went back in his office and thankfully my boss was a fellow gay man so I felt like he was sympathetic to my situation. I explained how I logged into my my Google docs to write fan fiction and just forgot to close the window. They understood or so I thought, cuz they later told me I was getting written up for looking up explicit content at the work place. I protested to this explaining how I was only on Google docs. Whoever brought this to you snooped through my Google drive and found these. They took that under consideration but said they still needed to write me up for this incident. 

So I took the punishment and they said I could go home for the day if I wanted to. So I did and when I got home I immediately logged into my Google drive and deleted all the scandalous photos. Then I went to my Google docs and guess what. That mother fucker deleted ALL MY DOC FILES. My docs were completely empty, all my stories and fan fiction were gone. I was livid. I tried calling my boss and explained to him what the person did but he couldn't do anything about it cuz they couldn't tell me who it was who reported me. So the next day I went into work and went on the employee schedule and found who was on the same job as me that following day so I knew exactly who it was and so I then reported that person to my boss for going through my personal account and he said he'd take care of it. So that was that and idk what came of that but at the end of the day what's done is done. 

I'm able to look back on that and just laugh and say wtf. My fiancé thinks it's a wild story and told me I should post it on here. So that's my story. 

TL;DR",,I logged into my Google docs to write fan fiction and forgot to close the incognito window on my work computer. Got caught by my boss and warehouse manager.
"TIFU Accidentally send my boss a spicy photo meant for someone else
(mark as NSFW):
This happened just a few hours ago and I still want to crawl under my bed and never return to society.

I work a fully remote job — it’s the usual: spreadsheets, Slack, boring meetings. But outside of that, I have a side hustle that’s a little more… creative. I usually keep both worlds completely separate. Until today.

I was creating some content for my side project — a cute little photoshoot in lingerie. I felt confident and wanted to send a preview to someone I’ve been talking to. He’s always very enthusiastic when I send him stuff, so I figured why not brighten his day?

Well, in my rush, I tapped the wrong “Tom” in my contacts. Instead of sending the photo to “Tom - Fun,” I sent it to “Tom - Work.” Yes. My boss.

Along with the photo, I also sent a cute caption that said:
“Hope you’re ready for more tonight, baby.”

Three seconds later, I realized what I had done. My soul left my body. I tried to delete the message but he had already seen it.
Then he replied:

“I assume this wasn’t meant for me.”

I didn’t know what to do, so I just… didn’t respond. I’ve been pacing around my apartment ever since, full of anxiety and regret. I have a one-on-one video call with him tomorrow morning and I’ve been seriously considering faking a power outage or food poisoning.

Anyway, I thought I’d share my moment of absolute horror with Reddit so I don’t suffer alone. Wish me luck, I’ll probably need it.","Took a cute lingerie pic for someone special, accidentally sent it to my boss along with a flirty caption. He saw it.

"TIFU by letting my son give me Poison Ivy as a gift
So this happened recently and I’m still dealing with the aftermath.

On March 25, my sweet 4-year-old came up to me outside and handed me a little plant he thought was “cute.” He was so proud and excited, and I just melted — took it from him without thinking twice, told him it was beautiful, and didn’t wash my hands right away.

Fast forward to April 7, and my legs look like hell.
(Pics can be found on my profile but trigger warning for anyone squeamish about rashes or open skin)

Apparently, the “cute” little plant was poison ivy, and I am very allergic. We didn’t even recognize it at the time, so I ended up brushing against it more later, and clearly my body decided to declare war.

The silver lining: my son is totally fine and seems to not be allergic at all (thank goodness). But me? I’m over here feeling like I just fought a bear in a briar patch.

I’m now on a strong steroid cream and popping antihistamines like candy. 10/10 will now always assume any unknown plant is poison until proven otherwise.

"TIFU by not turning off notifications on the app that shall not be named.
Sup.

So I'm a flatbed truck driver. I'm loading in Dallas, TX today and had walked into the shipper to check in. The guy in the shipping office was old, but nice. Seemed like a real gentle dude. He couldn't hear me clearly when I tried reading my pick up number to him. So he asked me to place my screen on the shelf so he could read it directly.

The shipping office was through a window, and on my side of the window is a shelf where I'd sign whatever I'd need to sign.

Now, on my phone has an app that starts with an ""iF"" and ends with an ""unny."" Users be Hella racist on that app, but it's memes are a dopamine source for my autistic ass so idgaf lol.

Problem is... The app likes to notify you with a caption of whatever meme it's featuring.

Well, unfortunately for me, it decided to notify me at the moment this nice old guy looked at my screen.

And what, dear reader, do you think the caption said?

""/\/**gers at it again""

Only it wasn't censored. That's for your benefit reader. 🙃

Now either the guy didn't read it, or he took that shit in stride, cause bro didn't flinch no NOTHING. He was old, so my only solice is that he may have LEGITIMATELY not read it and was focused on reading my pick up number.

I'll never know, but I know one thing: I cannot return to this location ever again. Either that, or I gotta murder this man to escape the humility of this social blunder. But I have as much balls to do it as he is deserving of such a thing 😭.

"TIFU by trying to self medicate with nicotine patches
So I (21f) have been diagnosed with adhd for around 7 years now and used to be on stimulant medication but due to law changes, the adderall shortage, and personal issues I’ve been unable to get my medication for over two years. I am about to graduate college but have been struggling getting work done and with basic self care tasks. I’ve been struggling with it my whole life but it worsened since not being on my medication and since I’m supposed be to graduating soon I’ve been really stressed about not getting my work done. 

So this is where the nicotine comes in, I’ve never taken nicotine (smoked, vaped, zines etc) but I was thinking that since nicotine and adderall are both stimulants I could start doing nicotine. I do some research and there is a study that has shown nicotine patches helping people with adhd. So I’m desperate to get help with my symptoms and I think it over and watch videos of other people who have tried it and one lady says she cuts hers in half. So I think great I’ll get the highest dose and cut it into thirds and that should be equivalent to the lowest dose. 

So I put 1/3 on a patch on before leaving the 30 minutes in to my first class it feels about how my adhd meds did but a bit jittery, about an hour in I start getting a headache. I sit down for a while and a girl in my class gives me half of her orange. About an hour and a half in it gets pretty bad so I take off the patch. I sit down for a while I then start getting nauseous so I walk out of class and go to the bathroom and start throwing up. That goes on until the end of class and I have half an hour before my on campus job. I sit around for a bit and start to feel better but after 20 minutes I start throwing up again. I call my boss and tell him I can’t work and that I’m sick from “medication side effects”. He says there should be someone else working at that time but there isn’t, he got the schedule for today confused with tomorrow’s. I call him again after checking the schedule and one of my coworkers is able to fill in. For the first 30 minutes of when my shift was supposed to be I was there not like actually doing my job but just trying to work things out with my boss and just keeping an eye on things. My coworker comes in and my partner comes to take me home.

Once I’m home I end up just sleeping it off but I felt like an idiot. I also find out that cutting it up doesn’t lower the dosage and messes with how much is released. So I’d actually taken the highest dose and it hadn’t released gradually as intended but probably way more quickly.","Tried to self medicate with nicotine patches, unintentionally took the highest dosage, and had a nicotine overdose throwing up and missing my class and job.","I’ve been on medication for 7 years, I’m about to graduate college but have been struggling getting work done and with basic self care tasks.

"TIFU
Last year, I broke up with my girlfriend. At the time, I thought I wasn’t happy—but six months ago, I had a serious realization that the issue wasn’t her or the relationship. It was me. I didn’t put in the effort. I wasn’t present. I’d reply to her texts with one-word answers like “fine” or “ok” when she was clearly trying to connect. Looking back at those messages makes me feel sick because she really cared and tried, and I gave her so little.

I reached out recently, and we started talking again. I told her how I feel and how much I’ve changed and grown. I apologized deeply and told her I now see what we had and how I’d treat her differently. But when I asked about possibly trying again, she told me she’s scared I’ll fall back into old patterns and hurt her again. She said she still needs time to heal and asked me not to contact her.

I feel crushed. Like I ruined something good and now it’s gone forever. I wish I could prove I’m not that guy anymore. But right now I feel lost, and the regret is overwhelming.

"TIFU in the bookstore
Hello again. It's been a while since I was cursed with a fuck up worth sharing on this sub.

I was in the bookstore the other day when I noticed the one and only Leah Gotti. For those of you who never heard of Leah Gotti, she does porn. As a fan of her work, I thought it was awesome to not only see her in person, but also to see her doing something so ordinary like checking out books in the sci-fi section. I decided to introduce myself and ask her if she was willing to take a selfie with me. As soon as I closed the distance between us, I said I was sorry for interrupting and explained that I was one of her biggest fans. She cut me off mid sentence and said she was not who I thought she was. She even showed me her ID, which did not say Leah Gotti. She said she was so fucking over people thinking she was someone whose career was to make men cum. I said I didn't mean to offend her. 

She asked me how would I feel if random people constantly believed I was Joey Mills. I said I had no idea know who that was, which prompted her to put down her book, pull out her phone, and show me the Google results for Joey Mills, who apparently did gay porn based on what I was seeing. I asked her if she actually thought I looked like that guy. She said that was just an example before telling me that I looked more like Will Poulter, before he became hot. I asked if this Will guy was another porn star or something. She looked like she wanted to scream at me at that point and said people do things other than fucking porn. I said I didn't mean to upset her. She informed me that I was the third fucking guy that day who thought she was Leah fucking Gotti and literally asked me to ask her how the fuck she knew I was the third fucking guy.

I was scared to ask, but I asked anyway because she was staring at me. She said the first fucking guy, who was old enough  to be her dad, sent her an unsolicited dick pic on social media because he thought she would love to see that shit since she was Leah Gotti. The second fucking guy approached her in public like I did, except she was not alone with a book, she was in the mall with her mom, and since second guy thought she was a successful porn star, he assumed her mom knew, which created an awkward situation when she had to explain to both her mother and a complete stranger that she never fucked anyone for money. She said her last relationship ended because her ex bf became uncomfortable with how many people thought she did porn. I responded with an awkward apology and eventually walked away when her response to my apology was to look at me until I finally got the message to fuck off. 

**TL:DR Approached a girl who I thought was a porn star and ended up getting roasted by a girl who was fed up with people thinking she was a porn star.**",,Leah Gotti is a douchebag.
"TIFU by using AI at work and then being exposed as a liar
Couple of months ago, I landed a job at a MNC. My boss, a nice guy in his late 50s, was openly proud about how he reached high level position without getting technology beyond basic emails and Excel sheets. But now he wanted a fresh techie to bring a new breeze to the team - hence, my role.

In the first few months, the tasks were ok, I cleaned up our CRM (on sheets), built some dashboards for the teams.

Then I used ChatGPT deep research to search about competitors and write drafts. What usually took the team three days, I could now do in two hours. My teammate called me a tech genius for that

I showed the design team the new chatGPT image and they still thank me until now for it . My boss said “I don’t know what you do, but keep it up!” No prob sir, I will continue asking chatGPT politely...

For meetings, I just let granola record it. For emails and notes, I’m too lazy to organize things so I set up a second brain called saner. Every time someone asked about meeting, emails, I just asked ai while they was still debating what was said. Do people not know this is possible?

My boss loved all of the results. He called me into his office and suggested I lead a training session to level up the rest of the team. I agreed, thinking how I'd basically be teaching everyone How to ask AI the right questions lol

Then yesterday. A coworker was demoing ChatGPT to another teammate during lunch. My boss happened to walk by and froze. I saw him stared at the screen and said, ""Wait, is that what (myname) has been doing?""

Then he called into a meeting and said, ""I trusted you. You made me look foolish bragging about your skills to clients and upper management. All your performance are from AI. You're a liar.""

He genuinely believed that using AI to do the work was deceptive!? I tried explaining that it's just a tool, like Excel but smarter, but he wasn't convinced. Luckily, some of my teammates and upper management already knew what I was doing and actually supported it. But this still caught me off guard and I’m not sure how to deal with the boss moving forward.","Used AI to work, boss found out, feels betrayed, and thinks I'm a liar.",Boss thinks I’m using AI at work and then accuses me of lying to clients and upper management.
"TIFU by telling my Italian mother-in-law I was getting “more vagina” this afternoon.
My wife is Italian, and my mother-in-law doesn’t speak very much English. My Italian is pretty mediocre-I can get around Milan, my vocabulary is decent, but my pronunciation and grammar are both horrible, and I will get words confused.

My wife was facetiming with her mom yesterday morning, and I popped over to say ciao to her. She started asking me the basics-“how are things? How’s work?” Etc. and then she asked my plan for the weekend.

I told her I was going to be running errands all morning. And then I tried to tell her in the afternoon we were going to be getting “pioviggine”-a little rain. Instead, I told her we were going to be getting “più vagina” - more vagina. 

My wife immediately gave me a look of absolute horror and pulled the phone away, her mom was silent and I couldn’t see her face. “WHAT?” She said, incredulously in English.

I looked at her confused and said it again. “Più vagina?”

Her reaction I can best describe through emojis: 😧🫢🫣✋🏻

“What are you trying to say???”

“…that it’s going to be raining a bit later?”

“…🤔…pioviggine??”

"TIFU by trying to impress my crush at work
So, I decided to show off a little at work today. My crush and I were in the break room, just casually talking about the weekend, and I thought I’d try to impress them. There was this huge stack of papers I needed to take to the printer, so I grabbed it all at once and strutted like I was some sort of office superstar. I was walking towards the printer when, of course, I tripped over the cord for the coffee machine, sending the papers flying everywhere. I couldn’t stop it, and the mug I had just filled with coffee toppled over, spilling everywhere. The whole break room went silent, and I just froze. My crush was staring at me in disbelief.

I spent the next 10 minutes picking up papers while trying to save face. I think I heard someone whisper, ""Smooth move,"" which made everything even worse. I can’t believe I actually thought that would impress them. Now I’m so embarrassed, I’m trying to figure out how to avoid eye contact with them for the next week.

Not today but reminded of it when my daughter told me ""I was going to be on a list"" for something and I told her I already was because of the Chuck E Cheese incident. 

I was a baseball coach once upon a time.  One of the families had a younger daughter, maybe 6 or 7 years old if I had to guess, and she would usually be at practice playing off to the side.  Birthday party day at Chuck E Cheese and she was there.  The brother and sister combo were dropped off.   I'm a sucker for their pizza and games, so I stayed.  I'm like the only parent that loved that place and I took the kids there quite often when they were younger.  

Striving to be the fun coach, I loaded up my card with an unlimited play option.  Anytime I saw a game finishing up for one of the kids, swipe.  Want to play the games that last 5 seconds?  Triple swipe.  I made for no game went unplayed.  I saw the sister playing a game by herself, so I hopped on over as it was finishing.  She went to one of the quick games and I told her to play like a maniac.  As she finished, I'd swipe.  She was having a blast, I was having fun watching her play.  Till her dad came over to get her.  And this dad was not the dad that I knew 😕.  He looked at me longer than I liked but said nothing.

I quickly made my way to the party table to show I wasn't there alone.  The sister was sitting at the table, and had a similar little sun dress on and a damn flower hair clip like the other girl.

"TIFU trying to catch the hatch door at work
I am a mixer operator at a bakery. We make hamburger buns, hotdog buns, dinner rolls, and those sweet party rolls. Part of my job is loading of the ingredients into the top of the mixer we have. It is very large, and I have to walk stairs to a platform in order to load it. Typically we have a couple of buckets of ingredients and some bags of sugar or potato flakes. Things like this. On Friday I was starting the process of loading it and one of the ingredients the batch received was an egg flavor liquid. Smells terrible, and it’s very thick. I walked up the platform, grabbed the liquid and realized the hatch wasn’t open. I opened it. Normally it springs right open, even though it is about 1/4th an inch thick steel. It has an air supply and uses this to aid in opening the hatch. It is very heavy.  When I opened it with my left hand it sprang all the way up, and then came back down. The air supply failed(or something went wrong) and for some strange reason my reflex was to try and catch the hatch with my left hand. 

My pinky was caught in a pinch point and was messed up bad. I received 6 stitches and have an open fracture around the last joint of my pinky.

"TIFU by breaking my leg and tearily confessed to smoking in front of my mother.
So this happened over ten years ago but I was reminded of this story the other day and thought I’d share. For context, I’m looking for a new doctor and requested my file from my old doctor and was going through it just out of curiosity, and saw a note saying that I had a history of smoking. And honestly, I have only ever smoked once in my life and was so confused as to why this was on my chart, until I saw the date that is was added, which was my 18th birthday, or also the day I broke my leg. 

Just for some background info, I was raised in a very conservative, catholic family, and was taught very young to never drink or do drugs or to smoke, especially if underaged. But smoking was very heavily emphasized due to my grandmother, who used to heavily smoke, and now had several health problems because of it. And I was such a little goody two-shoes, that of course I would never even think about doing such things! My catholic guilt was in top form at this time and the thought of disobeying my mom left me too anxious to function.

My friend also grew up in a similar family but was a little more rebellious than me. Nothing crazy, but she picked up smoking from her older sister and would have her sister buy her cigarettes for her since she was still only 17 ( this was when the law was when you had to be 18, btw). 

Well on the day of my 18th birthday, my friend and I were hanging out after school, and she offered me a cigarette and since I was technically legal now, I said what the heck! Let’s at least give it a try! It won’t hurt to try just one! So I smoked like 1/2 a cigarette before giving it back to my friend because, honestly, it was gross, and I did not see the appeal at all.

Well less than an hour later, we were rollerblading through the park, when a little kid runs in front of me. I went to quickly dodge him only for me to step onto a crack that was big enough for the wheels on my rollerblade to get wedged in. My foot was truly stuck, but thanks to the laws of physics, my body kept going while my foot stayed in place, until I heard some loud cracks and fell. 

I think I went into shock right after because the only thing I remember after that was telling my friend to call for an ambulance because I was pretty sure I just broke my leg. I did, in fact, just break my leg. In three places to be precise! 

I remembering arriving at the hospital by myself because my friend wasn’t allowed with me and i was super anxious because they were asking me for my medical history and telling me that I would probably need surgery to repair it, and I was like, um can we wait for my mom to get here! Like yes I’m technically an adult and I should probably know the answers to these questions but I’ve only been a legal adult for less than 12 hours! And so far, it has not been a great experience! Give me a break please! Also! I’m in a lot of pain and can barely think because of it!

By the time my mom has made it to the hospital, I was hooked up to an IV and was given some morphine and boy was it showing. I remember crying to her about how sorry i was to have bothered her while she was at work and sorry for making her leave early to come take care of me. Bless my mom, because she just comforted me and told me there was nothing to be sorry about and that of course she would come take care of me, especially when I was hurt!!! 

Well after a while the nurses started asking me more questions because they wanted me to go into surgery as soon as possible. They asked if it was possible I was pregnant? Did I drink? Did I do any drugs? All of them quickly answered with a negative because I was a good girl who never did anything wrong!

But then they asked if I smoked, and felt my stomach drop. Oh no…. I looked at my mom…. I looked at my nurse…. I looked at my mom…. And then, after a way too long pause,  I burst into gut wrenching sobs!!! Just snot and tears pouring down my face while I apologized to my mom over and over again! Saying it was only one cigarette and I promise to never do it again and how I was so sorry! I was utterly beside myself. I have no idea what the nurse must have been thinking because I was too busy begging my mom to forgive me!

Again, bless my mother, because she hardly bat an eye at the over the top confession, and was mostly just trying to calm me down. 

She never brought it up to me afterwards and we never talked about it. I think she was worried I would burst into tears again!

So that’s the story of how I got ‘history of smoking’ added to my medical file apparently!","I broke my leg on my 18th birthday and burst into tears when a nurse at the hospital asked if I smoked, and sobbingly apologized to my strict, conservative mother for having smoked a cigarette earlier that day, all while high on morphine.",Broke my leg smoking on my 18th birthday and confessed to smoking in front of my mother.
"TIFU by showing my wife and son the OG transformers movie
Spoiler warning for the 1986 transformers the movie!

So, I 30M and my wife 36F love doing ""Saturday morning cartoons"" with our son 5M. I grew up watching the original transformers and have been watching it with my son since he was two. He absolutely loves Optimus Prime and has plenty of transformers toys.

 Last night I played ""Dare to be Stupid"" and mentioned it was from the cartoon movie, I didn't realize I had never shown him the movie and said we could watch it this morning.

  My son has watched many 90's and early '00s cartoons and is used to characters dying off, but I didn't realize how hard he would take it when Optimus died, and didn't even have a strong reaction when he almost died in Transformers One. He screamed and started balling after he died. My wife gets really emotional in sad parts in movies too, but this is the most upset we've both seen him get, so both my wife and son are full on sobbing after Optimus died. I was absolutely bewildered, because I didn't react this way when I saw the movie at around the same age and we've already seen him return in the show and knew he wasn't dead forever.

 My son couldn't even take a nap, and is still upset even though we stopped the movie and I showed him the episode where Optimus comes back to life. My wife is mad because I should have warned her that it could potentially be upsetting to our son. I have no clue how else to console him 

TL:DR: TIFU by potentially traumatizing our son when Optimus died in the original transformers movie.",,TIFU by potentially traumatizing our son when Optimus died in the original transformers movie.
"TIFU by coming out at my best friend’s birthday party and accidentally ruining the whole thing (Part 1)
 
So, this is a story that still makes me cringe, but I thought I'd share it here because, well, it’s been years and I still haven’t lived it down.

Back when I was 16, I was, uh, just figuring stuff out. I wasn’t out yet, at least not in a big way. It wasn’t like I was hiding it, I just hadn’t told people yet because I didn’t really know how. It was also a weird time for me. Social situations always felt like walking through a maze blindfolded, and sometimes I couldn’t quite figure out how to act or what to say. I remember trying to make eye contact with people and failing terribly at it. I’ve always been more of a listener than a talker, and people didn’t always know how to take that. But I had this one best friend, let’s call him Ben, who had been my rock for the longest time. He was super chill, and we could always talk about the dumbest things for hours.

Anyway, Ben’s birthday was coming up, and he was throwing a party at his house. It was one of those big gatherings where everyone from school was invited. The usual crowd—people I didn't really talk to but saw every day. I figured I’d just keep to myself, you know, hang out with the people I knew, maybe drink a little (not that I could handle it at the time), and just try not to mess things up too much.

But then something changed that week. It was like I couldn’t ignore it anymore. I had this… urge, like I needed to tell someone. I needed to tell him, my best friend, how I felt. I didn’t know why, but I just knew I had to. Maybe it was the fact that we were getting older and stuff was starting to change, or maybe it was that Ben was the only person who seemed to get me, even if I wasn’t always able to explain myself well. We had always been super close, and I thought maybe he’d understand.

So, fast forward to the party. The moment came and I just… I blurted it out. I wasn’t thinking, honestly, I just kind of grabbed him by the sleeve and said, “I like guys.”

I remember the look on his face, like he didn’t know what to say. And I get it now, I really do. It was random. It was out of nowhere. Everyone was having a good time, and suddenly, I dropped this huge bomb. I’d barely even said the words before I started feeling my cheeks burn and my brain went into overdrive. All I could hear was my heartbeat, so loud that it felt like I was going to pass out.

Ben, to his cr",,I came out to my best friend at his birthday party and accidentally ruined the whole thing.
"TIFU by drenching my bedroom in amaro
Obligatory this happened a couple of weeks ago

I don’t need to waste too much time with preamble, suffice to say I am not the most organised, and my room contains a lot of clutter. This included both a large pile of laundered and folded clothes (ready to be put in the draws), and an assortment of amaros. For the unaware, these are bittersweet Italian liqueurs typically drunk after a meal (as a digestif) or used in cocktails. Examples include Ramazzotti, Averna, Fernet, and Cynar (our victim here).

Given my shitty organisation and procrastination, the bottles of amaro ended up perched on a tall lidded basket. Immediately to the right of this basket was the clothes pile, and to the left (and lower down) an open bag filled with a variety of items, including a spare laptop, and a large folded plastic sheet akin to a tarpaulin (don’t ask). The pile of clothes was rubbing right against the balanced bottles, and anyone sensible (i.e. not me) would have realised that this was a disaster waiting to happen...

So I had just got out of bed, ready to enjoy my day off, and needed a pair of jeans from the pile. They were, however, in the middle, sandwiched by a great quantity of clothes above and below. Being impatient, I decided to try pulling the desired pair of jeans from out the pile. This made the pile wobble, dislodging the bottle of Cynar, and sending it crashing down to the left of the basket, landing next to the open bag (in a gap), upside down.

At first it seemed as if there was no problem, and I picked up the bottle. “Wait… oh fuck oh fuck OH FUUUCCKKK!!!!” – my words at the time. It turned out that, during its descent, the bottle smashed against the wall, and a large chunk of glass flew out of the bottom. This caused a decent amount of the liquid inside to splash into the open bag. This was bad enough, but upon lifting the bottle, most of what was left inside tipped out all over the floor, my feet, and onto a laptop bag (nothing inside) that was lying on the floor next to me.

It was a disaster. My mum and I had to get to work on cleaning the floor with rags and soapy water, FAST, to save the carpet from being permanently stained. Fortunately, we succeeded. All the while, we were finding tiny fragments of glass that had flew away from the bottle when it broke, and I also had to painstakingly pick these out of the carpet.

With that crisis sorted, my attention turned to the open bag that a portion of the liqueur flew into after the initial breakage. I was very concerned that the laptop inside would be a write off. Again, fortunately, the worst it got was a few drops on the keyboard and screen. It turned out most of this initial wave of Italian digestif was caught in the folds of the plastic sheet.

After washing it out in the bath, I was left wondering how I was possibly going to dry this thing, and, at this point, the absurdity of my situation was starting to dawn on me. Scene: I am desperately trying to throw a plastic sheet over a washing line, and I’m laughing my ass off!

Honestly it didn’t turn out nearly as bad as it could have, but I have now (somehow!) found the motivation to move my liqueur bottles to a better location where they cannot be easily knocked over… and I have put the clothes back in the draws where they belong.",procrastination and impatience led to an inevitable Italian booze bukkake,Don’t drink amaro.

"TIFU by mistaking a medical response for an orgasm
TIFU- actually happened today. So I got the best head of my life earlier today from this guy- no joke, first guy to get me to cum from head alone and I felt one of the best orgasms of my life. I felt my abdomen contract and tingles all over my body like my nerves were on fire. Then it persisted for a couple minutes and I was wondering if this is a 'real orgasm' and what have I been missing all my life??

Started getting itchy all over and I asked the guy if he did any drugs and he said no. A few minutes later on the bus home I'm getting hives and a runny nose and realized I'm probably allergic to his cat hah.

Still best head ever

TL:DR: thought I had a heavenly out of this world orgasm but instead it was an orgasm coinciding with an allergic reaction- perfect timing",,got the best head of my life from a guy who got me to cum from head alone and now I'm allergic to his cat
"TIFU by making a 5 big booms joke on a first date.
Wow. I never thought I’d post on a subreddit like this, but I came back from a first date a couple of hours ago and am still feeling absolutely mortified, so maybe writing it out will feel cathartic.

I (20F) recently downloaded hinge for the first time and began swiping. I’ve never gone out on a date through a dating app before, so safe to say I was absolutely shitting bricks for tonight’s first date with “Brian” (22M). Although we started talking off of the app prior to the date, we hadn’t actually spoken on the phone, so I didn’t really know what to expect in terms of how our conversation would flow in person. 

Fast forward to tonight and we ended up meeting at this cute Paint bar! Everything was going great until the topic of pets was brought up. He noticed my Lock Screen of my cat and asked if it was mine. I said yes and asked about his pets, as I remembered he had a pic with two dogs on his profile. He got out his phone to show me pictures of them and sadly told me how one of them, a white crunchy looking yorkie named Roxie, had recently passed after new years. 

Now, I have no idea what possessed me in that moment—maybe satan, maybe Roxie— but I simply responded, “Aww, she gets 5 big booms.” He weirdly looked at me and just went, “What?” It was in that moment I knew I fucked up. He didn’t get the reference. I knew I had already shot myself in the foot when I said it, as I’m awful when it comes to sensitive topics like death or grieving, but I had hoped he’d let out a little laugh and we’d move on. 

But no. I initially tried sweeping it under the rug by saying, “oh it’s nothing, it’s just from this silly video,” but he proceeded to ask me to show it to him. I awkwardly laughed and went “really?” Really. So I opened up TikTok and showed him the clip. Brian, and I’m assuming Roxie (RIP), didn’t find it funny. He just sat there and went, “oh I get it now.” From that point I knew the date was doomed, so I just gave him an apologetic smile and tried to make the most of things by placating the situation (thankfully we were wrapping up with our paintings by then). 

All in all, now I know NOT to try to lighten the mood of a grieving dog parent by bringing up a brain rot joke. Especially on a first date. Sorry Brian, and sorry Roxie. You deserve more than 5 big booms.","I said a stupid TikTok joke in response to a first date telling me about his recently deceased dog. I then proceeded to show him said video, as he didn’t understand the reference, thus digging myself an even deeper hole.

Update (I think this is where you put it): 

Oh. My. God. I’m a little terrified at how over 800,000 people viewed my story, but it looks like my faux pas made at least a few of you smile so at least there’s that. “Brian” (which dw isn’t his real name), to all of our surprise, texted me this morning saying how he had a good time last night and would like to see me again. I guess the 5 big booms didn’t scare him away after all! 

In all seriousness though thank you for the much needed laugh. And for those who were disappointed by my TikTok usage, try not to worry about the future generation too much. We can be driven and also enjoy an extremely dumb joke here and there. 🐣❤️",I made a 5 big booms joke on a first date.
"TIFU by leaving my CPAP on the bus
I travel across the US with some frequency, and on one particular occasion, funds were tight, so I  choose a trip with multiple stops & a plane change in order to save some money. Of course, there were delays and missed flights... At the end of it all, I had been traveling for over 14 hours and I was exhausted. 

I live in a major metropolitan area, so taking public transit back from the airport is my usual means of getting home. In this case, I got back so late that I literally caught the last bus running on my route for the night. I was practically slipping in and out of consciousness when the bus got to my stop. I hopped off, grabbed my suitcase and started to cross the street when I realized I had left my $1,500 CPAP on the bus! 

By the time I realized what had happened, the bus was already over a block away. The bus was going towards a less desirable part of the city, so I was sure it was gone forever. I tried calling the bus dispatch center but it was way past business hours and all I could do was leave a message on their lost-and-found answering service. 

I sat there at the bus stop in stunned silence. 

I couldn't afford a replacement. I was freaking out about what might happen if I had to sleep for weeks without a CPAP until I could get it replaced. I looked up, saw a church across the street and thought to myself, ""at this point, it couldn't hurt"" 😄😢 So I just asked whatever entity or imaginary sky-finger that might be out there to help a weary traveler out. 

I sat there for a while longer, trying to call non-emergency police dispatch, the bus station terminal, googling my options for a cheap replacement machine, etc. 

Suddenly, off in the distance I see a bus coming back from the opposite direction. I flagged them down and asked the driver if they found anything, but it was the wrong bus. She got on the radio and asked the other bus drivers still out there if they found anything and one of them said yes & that they were on their way back! 

I couldn't believe that it survived and that she was actually kind enough to answer the other operator. (She later told me that they're not allowed to return things to people after they've excited the bus. They're supposed to go to lost & found at the depot, if you can believe it. Company policy or whatever. lol)","- left my $1500 CPAP on the last city bus on my route for the night.

"TIFU by letting a homeless man crash at my place
So I recently moved to a new town about a month ago. I met this homeless guy at a laundromat and he didn’t have any money to wash his clothes so I help him out. I didn’t have any friends yet and as I’ve been in hard times before I decide to hang out with him. So we end up just kicking it the whole day and I buy him food, booze and we even got haircuts together lol. I thought he seemed pretty genuine so I let him stay at my place, which turned into a couple nights. His obvious fault was that he was an alcoholic so I drop him off at a local detox facility.

This of course ramps up to him getting kicked out and him constantly calling me for help, so I start pushing him away slowly because I can’t do everything for this guy. I also learn he’s been to like every rehab in the state, but doesn’t last more than a week at any of them. Somehow his insurance has covered this. He even just shows up at my door one day so I regretfully let him stay once more but this is the last time.

Well today he starts blowing me up again leaving me tons of messages and voicemails. I say I can’t do it anymore man, I’m sorry. He then leaves a voicemail threatening me saying he’ll go to jail, I’ll have to kill him, all this nonsense and screaming the n word. I’m not even black.

"TIFU: Slight mishap overcoming type one egg allergy, may have undone all exposure progress to get over it….
So, first let me begin with a little helpful information. There are two *main* types of egg allergy. First, is your allergic to the “raw” protein that gives eggs their gelatinous texture, which changes in structure when exposed to heat, rendering it perfectly safe to consume when thoroughly WELL cooked (this means no runny, soft boiled and/or pasteurized in the *least* bit at its worst), with the other being simply NO egg products **PERIOD** which can even include certain skin care products, medicines, medical treatments and vaccines. 

Personally, I’m type one, and have only recently (within the last few years) reached the extreme end of it, with not being able to enjoy things like mayo, Cesar salad dressing and egg nog (which I made a separate, hellish post on a few years back if you want to check my history, or I can link it below).

Since then, I’ve been SLOWLY working on exposure therapy to reduce my reaction over time to both pasteurized egg products and cats (another story) and have seen some success on both ends! I’ve been able to enjoy small amounts of mayo, kitty cuddles and some salad dressings since maybe August of last year, with strict monitoring and maintenance of my symptoms/reactions, and it’s been GREAT!!!!! Completely new lease on life with potential hope for enough recovery to one day try soft boiled eggs several different ways, AND enjoy indoor cat company, at least for a little bit without Death waiting in the corner for me.

Well, cut to today, where I made Cesar salads for dinner…. I severed the salads with homemade croutons, just to be extra fancy. That mistake, led to my downfall.

WHY???? (You might ask…?)

Croutons, are not only crunchy, but *abrasive*…. Eating them meant that I slightly and subtlety scratched away at the thin membrane lining of my mouth, gums and throat, allowing my allergen trigger to penetrate my immune system a little more deeply than it normally should have. Cue massive swelling, burning and itching from my chapped lips, to my mouth and pipes *all the way down….* I’m currently miserable, tired as hell and not allowed to sleep until sunrise (at the very least) so that I can monitor my symptoms and their progression ***just in case*** it turns into a serious emergency.

All I wanted was to enjoy a salad that I rarely get to have, but because I got over zealous, I’m paying the price. And the worst part, is that depending on how my body reacts and how I recover, I might have to begin the exposure process all over again, probably at a MUCH slower pace, and it could take years before I’m back to where I was in my journey. Fingers crossed it won’t be the worst case scenario, but we’ll find out….","I WAS getting over an egg allergy through slow exposure therapy, but decided to eat a salad with croutons and egg based dressing which shredded my mouth and throat, leading to an active allergic reaction.

"TIFU by talking about a condom
I’m a college student and I’m doing my best to make friends. Thankfully, a girl I was talking to wanted to set me up with her sister (as a friend) and her roommate. Given how I’ve been down in the dumps recently, I figured I’d give it a shot. 

After my class today, I walked over to the dorm hall that they were staying in and waited about 10 minutes. They came down to the lobby where I was and brought me back up to their dorm on the third floor. 

After we got settled, they told me they were going to hotbox in the bathroom and that I was coming with them. I’m not a smoker by any stretch of the imagination, but I didn’t mind sitting there watching them rotate and making small talk. 

This is where I fuck up. At some point, the girl in question mentions something about the roommate having a “dick appointment”. I thought out loud that I wasn’t there for that, trying to make myself clear. I said something along the lines of, “I’ve got a condom in my backpack but I promise I’m not here for anything like that”. Why the hell I said it, I have no idea, so I’ll just blame my Asperger’s. 

Then I dig my grave. They mention something about the LGBTQ+ group on campus giving out condoms and they bring up the fact that condoms expire. So I went to grab the one I had to see if it was expired. I told them again I had no intention of being there for a hookup, and I made a remark about the weird way the warning was sideways compared to the branding. 

After they finished hotboxing, I sat next to her on her bed in the dorm room watching SML. At some point, I say, “Can I ask you something stupid? Can I get a hug? I just really need one, it’s been a rough day.”

She said that she didn’t do physical contact and I respected her answer and her wishes. At about 1:30, they kick me out of the dorm room because the roommate’s parents were coming to pick up something. I said my goodbyes and left. I texted the initial girl who set us up and they had been talking about the condom incident. I apologized and said I was just trying to make small talk and that I didn’t mean anything by it. I saw as she left me on delivered then blocked me, and I went ahead and did the same with her sister. 

I feel so horrible about what I said, and I know that they think I’m some creep or pervert despite me not only not being one, but not coming off as one. I was just trying to make conversation in an area where I felt out of place.","I fucked up by talking about condoms when meeting a potential new friend.

"TIFU by accidentally making My High Quality Mic Sound Like a Dying Microwave for 2 Years

In 2022, I got me a mic. I’d been wanting to get into PC games and voice chat. It was shitty and came with a pop filter, but after months of work, it was still shitty. I didn’t want to go online with bad audio, so I researched several videos and decided to get a popular microphone. I saw my favorite YouTuber have it (he didn’t promote it) and thought it would be fine. Immediately dropped $50 on it. It was known for its high quality for its cheap price. I got the money from my mom in exchange for giving her my old mic when she wants to use it in the future and helping her set it up once I figure out how. The quality was noticeably better but not great.

After 2 fucking years, I was considering buying a new one since the quality didn’t change. I thought maybe my voice was bad, or I plugged it into the wrong side, is the cord broken? Nothing. 

I watched every filter tutorial, every audio mixer setting video, and nothing. Every plug in it was like putting glitter on shit. I sounded like I was asking for ransom for somebody’s loved one. Then, while increasing my sensitivity, I noticed an “audio enhancement.” It was enabled with a description that clearly stated that if it’s enabled, it might clash with the microphone and distort audio. I disabled it, and I’ve never been happier to hear my own voice. 

I don’t know if the tutorial mentioned it while I wasn’t paying attention or something, but that instantly fixed it. I put on the pop filter from my first microphone on it. The thing fit like a super senior in a sophomore, but it made the mic sound even better! I don’t know when I enabled it, but I can really hear the quality now. Its light a weight being lifted from my shoulder, I can finally stop thinking about it.

I can’t wait to get cussed out on PC! :D","When I first got my second microphone, I enabled “Audio Enhancement,” which ironically clashed with the original audio, distorting it.

"TIFU by having head surgery and waking up mid-dart tournament in my mind


So yeah. This happened today and I’m still processing both the medical part and the utter, blinding embarrassment that followed.

I had a double surgery. On my head. I won’t get into the specifics, but imagine two surgeons spelunking into my skull like it’s a Minecraft biome, looking for whatever the hell was broken. Great start already. Part of the story that it wasn't a brain surgery, they have just worked extremely close to my brain and eyes.

Now, I arrived early and, to calm my nerves, I played Boombit Darts Club on my phone. I am on the autism spectrum, HFA, and I am pretty much obsessed with this game and I play a lot. I am also quite high ranked on world rank list, and I play very nice professional players every day. So I played, for two hours. Straight. I wasn’t just casually playing—I was in full tryhard mode. As my life depends on it, as the only possible side effect of this surgery was brain damage, so I thought this could be my last grind.... Every throw, every bullseye, I was telling myself: “You’ve got this. Become the dart. BE THE DART.”

Eventually, it’s time for the anesthesia. They wheel me in. I’m already buzzing from the IV drip, but still clutching imaginary darts in my mind. My last semi-coherent thought before blacking out was, “Alright, one more 180 for glory.”

Then the lights go out.

Smash cut to: I wake up. Still woozy, eyes half-closed, brain doing the Windows XP reboot sound. But my subconscious? Fully locked in. Because, folks, I woke up still thinking I was playing Darts Club.

And I committed.

I literally raised my hand like I was holding a phone. I stared at nothing, lined up the shot with imaginary crosshairs, took a deep breath… and ""threw"" my first dart. Only in my mind, though. My body? Post-surgery burrito mode. The dart didn’t “release.” So I frowned. Reset. Lined up again.

Still nothing. Didn't release for 20 seconds, and my time run out...

Disappointment. Pure, unfiltered disappointment. I made an audible groan. Like I’d just missed a million-dollar jackpot. And then I heard it: soft voices in the room.

Nurse 1: “...Is he awake?”
Nurse 2: “I think he’s playing some kind of mobile game?”
Doctor: “Does he think he’s bowling?”

No, Doctor, I don’t think I’m bowling. I’m deep in an imaginary professional darts match, and I'm trying to recover from a missed triple 20, okay?

Realizing they were watching this unfold in real time, I panicked and tried to look casual. So I started scratching my forehead. With what? My fully bandaged, post-op head, wrapped like a mummy’s ego. I looked like I was trying to interpret alien signals with my eyebrows.

Then came the laughter. My own.

I let out this weird, semi-unhinged, still-loopy laugh. Not a normal chuckle. It was more like a cartoon villain doing taxes. I couldn’t stop. The nurses kind of stepped back. One of them looked concerned. Another just whispered, “He's probably fine.”

Eventually, my brain rebooted fully, and I realized I had just re-enacted an invisible darts championship with an audience of actual medical professionals who had just cracked open my skull. So it was a Whack a Frap moment again. If you remember my post abouth the mysterious laptop I bought that didn't work if an unshowered male users used it ... If not, go and find it, it went viral, it was a gold...

So yeah, TIFU by not only playing mobile darts before head surgery, but also waking up and trying to finish the match in my dreams... out loud... with my body.

If you ever want to feel pure shame while also being physically numb and mentally baked—10/10, highly recommend.

I asked AI to polish up the story I told it, as I can't write or type yet....","Woke up after head surgery thinking I was still playing mobile darts, mimed throwing shots, got sad, fake-scratched my bandaged head, and laughed like a lunatic in front of the medical team.","Had head surgery, woke up mid-dart tournament in my mind."
"TIFU when I recommended some books to a customer
I work at a bookstore and a bit over a week ago this woman (who looked like she was probably in her late 40's to early 50's) came in and asked me for help with picking out some books for her son's birthday. She told me that her son liked to read and gave some examples of books he really liked. All of her examples were books written for adults, so because of that combined with her age, I assumed her son was probably an adult or at least an older teen. 

I helped her pick out a couple of books that seemed similar to the ones her son read and loved, but then she also mentioned that she wanted to get some horror books for her son. Apparently he had just gotten into watching horror movies, so she wanted to get him some horror books to get into too. I asked which horror movies he liked, and she couldn't really give me any actual titles. 

She could, however, give very short, terrible descriptions of some movies. Some of those I could piece together the movie from her description, some I couldn't. One of the movies she mentioned that he liked was one where (and I quote) ""these people try to get out of all these traps this guy set."" That was her full description, and from that, I thought the movie she was talking about was Saw, since that's the most famous movie where that's basically the premise, and because I assumed her son was an adult or teen. Another description was just ""a movie about a serial killer."" 

So, I picked out a bunch of books that I thought her son might like, and some of these books were really heavy (both Piercing and Audition by Ryu Murakami, American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis, Perfume by Patrick Suskind, and both Haunted and Lullaby by Chuck Palahniuk, to name a few I remember off the top of my head). She seemed really grateful, bought a bunch of the books I suggested, and I thought that was that. 

Well, a couple days ago, she came in again and was absolutely pissed. She said she'd skimmed the books before wrapping them and thought a bunch of them were completely inappropriate, and only then dropped the bombshell that her son was turning 11. She was beyond furious, and wanted to return the books and get a refund (which she got). Absolutely ruined that day for me (and presumably her, too).",- I recommended some hardcore horror novels to a woman who was shopping for her 11 year-old son's birthday.,"Woman wanted to get her son some horror and horror books for his birthday, but couldn't give me any actual titles or descriptions of the movies she was talking about, and I assumed her son was an adult or teen."
"TIFU by telling my husband I had a pimple.
Hello all. I'm (37 F) not really a Reddit user but I'm in need of one or several impartial third parties over this pimple I got, and what happened after I told my husband about it. 

Three days ago I felt something uncomfortable in my nethers while intimate with my husband (35 M). It was late so I decided to get some sleep and try to get a look at it the next morning. The following day I take a mirror and find a white, hard, smooth, uncomfortable, pea sized lump on the labia minora, close to my entrance. 

This has never happened to me before, and when I consulted Dr. Google, it basically told me I either had a cyst, a STI, or cancer, so I quickly called my actual Dr. and had a last minute emergency appointment scheduled for the following day. The receptionist was very nice and said it sounded like a pimple and not to worry too much. 
The next day comes and lo and behold, the bump and all discomfort disappear. I was relieved, but still decided I should go to my appointment to be sure. 

Here is where I feel I fucked up. My husband works from home, and so I told him I would be going to a gyno appointment, so I will let our kids play video games after school so they don't disturb him. I wouldn't have said more than that but he literally asked me what I was going there for. I told him about the bump, what Google said, what the receptionist said, and tried to make a light joke about it by saying ""just so you know, if they find anything, there will be divorce papers."" He did not laugh, but kept a very stoic face and told me he agreed. The vibes were not good yall. I shake it off, and go back to cleaning up the house before I pick up the kids like I always do. 

The appointment took longer than I expected to be there for, but I can't complain because she's the most popular gyno in town, and I'm getting squeezed in last second. She came in, took a look, and told me it was most likely a sebaceous cyst/pimple, and that it had resolved itself so well that she could hardly tell where it had been. When I told her I was worried because I didn't know pimples could occur there, she essentially told me skin was skin, and if I ever needed to I could take an intimate photo and send it to her through the patient portal. That way she could message me whether or not something looked ""exciting"" down there. She didn't charge me any money at all, and I left with a bounce in my step, calling my husband to tell him how it went and find out how the kids were doing. 

I finished talking and could FEEL his silences. He was not ok, even after hearing this news. I feel extra weird now, like he's mad at me and I don't know why. I end the call and rush home to make it home in time to make dinner. Husband had to work late but before he goes into his meeting he asked me for some kind of test result he could see. I told him she didn't end up testing me, but I could show him the appointment notes on the patient portal that she wrote. He looks, seems satisfied, and goes back to work, so I delivered him his dinner, and did bedtime with the kids alone.

You're probably thinking, ""he's being mad and weird because he thinks you cheated on him"". That's what I thought until further introspection. We both work from home. I'm mostly a SAHM but I am also in the middle of writing and illustrating my first children's book. I don't go out anywhere except to the backyard to take care of our pet chickens, and to the school to drop off/pick up our kids.Pick up takes anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour. 

Husband also has cameras on the front doorbell and other places in our house, AND he is the only one with access to view the footage. He told me it costs extra to add me and allow me to see footage too. He's also got this thing called ""firewalla"" which I believe can see what devices are being used in his home and what they are doing. Im not tech savvy at all, but this is another device I don't have access to. 

All of this has me suspicious as Hell, so by the time my husband comes out of his late night meeting, I'm fuming. I hopped in the shower while he decompressed in the living room, closed the door to get dressed, and didn't come back out or open the door. He chose to sleep on the couch, and since picking up on my current angry introspection he has made 0 attempts to talk to me about it, but has been using the couch as his new bed every night. I am happy to provide more information in the morning if anyone needs it. For now I need to try to sleep.","I told my husband I got a pimple on my nethers and now I think he cheated on me. 

Update: first and foremost, I want to whole heartedly apologize for not putting paragraphs in when I wrote this. It was very late/early and I did noooot think this would get so much attention. I fixed it (I hope) so again, sorry about that. 

I want to give a little bit of background before I talk about how our conversation went. For starters, my husband and I were in therapy together last year because of how destructive our communication is when we are both upset. 

It's the same tired pattern. I bring up a behavior or action he did present day, he gets immediately aggravated. I try to keep the focus on the current problem, he starts bringing up grievances he has from anywhere between 1-12 years ago. Feelings get ignored by both of us, because he's on the attack and arguing semantics about the past like it's evidence, and im trying to get a straight answer for present day. All four horsemen show up yall. It sucks. 

The therapist said all of those old arguments need to stay in the past and all of those hurts need to be acknowledged but also let go, because there is no way to move forward and heal if you keep dragging yourselves backwards all the time. She also told me about the wheel of power and control (privately) when I told her I caught him lying about putting a gps tracker on our car. At that time the flags were pink, not red, and I really thought we could work through this. 

So this morning I go to him, ask if we can talk privately in the bedroom. I'm nervous and praying we can get through this convo with calm respect for each other. We even recorded it on his phone, because he has claimed multiple times im manipulative. I hope he listens to it. 

I told him I felt he had been really weird and cold when I told him about the pimple and after when I confirmed it and showed him the Dr. notes. He is immediately aggravated, raised voice, ""of course I was! I thought you were telling me I was diseased!"" I brought up how we are both literally home all of the time except for when I go pick up the kids, and how he has the only access to the cameras.

 I also said I wanted access to the camera footage too (not the first time we've had this conversation btw), and he again said 
We had agreed it was too expensive. When I asked for his login and password he said he can't do that because it's a SSOP (?), but he'll try to figure it out. The surveillance he uses is wyze lab, and if anyone has helpful info about that I would so appreciate it.

I then mentioned I don't have access to the Robin Hood account anymore. This account has the majority of our savings so we can try to move out of FL. He said he would look into that later. I then asked him if he could understand how I would find this behavior suspicious when he is the one with all the power and surveillance. 

Then the old pattern happened again. He listed a slew of past grievances as evidence for HIM being suspicious of me instead of acknowledging any of my feelings or answering my questions. Things like:

You hugged my friend weird in front of me (5 years ago)

You went to that wedding without me (A planned and talked through discussion 6 years ago. Our son was not one to ""sit"" at weddings or in cars, and I was matron of honor.)

A car was parked on the street late at night by our house around the same time you told me you went out for a smoke. (One year ago. Literally didn't know about any car until he was shaking with anger and showing me camera footage.)

You were gone all the time when you did theater (my last play was in 2013, a solid three years before we had children.)

There were more. Many more. I had sworn to myself last year if this happens again I would be done, and I knew as each grievance gets addressed he has another in the chamber ready to go until we both get to a boiling point. I said I had enough. I was done. This discussion wasn't helpful or on topic. I wanted to separate, and if he was willing to go back to our therapist together I would do that, but for now I was done. He agreed until he realized I meant separation that is farther than the bed and the couch. 

""YOU CANT KICK ME OUT! This is MY HOUSE!"" I told him this is my house too, my money was used for half the down payment and my name is on the deed. I then reminded him his parents have a big quiet house where he can stay and get work done, whereas my mom is currently housing and nursing my Mema who broke her hip last month. He has somewhere to go. I don't. He tried a few more times but I did the hard thing and held my ground until he packed a bag and called his mom. 

We have therapy on Tuesday, but this is where I will be leaving you, Reddit. I thank you all for reading and I will try to reply to some of you after I do bedtime with the kids.","Told my husband I had a sebaceous cyst/pimple, he didn't believe me."
"TIFU by Eating Chipotle
Obligatory “this didn’t happen today”. When I was 13 my mental health was in the gutter. My home life was falling apart, I had just skipped a grade and was navigating that socially and overall I was just not handed the best deck of life cards. Anyhow, my dad at the time had just moved me and my brother back in with our now stepmom. I got a text from the woman he cheated on our stepmom with asking to go shopping with her and her son. I put two and two together and figured out he hadn’t told her he was back with our stepmom. Me being me I took the liberty of telling her the truth and almost instantly regretted it. A slurry of nastily worded texts and phone calls erupted from my dad and the next thing I knew I was in the kitchen downing a bottle of acetaminophen. I went to lay in my bed waiting for whatever I thought death felt like and fell asleep. I woke up to my grandma shaking me and went to stay with her for the week. Fast-forward two years later, I’m living with my grandma (for reasons unrelated to the previous incident) and life is pretty good. Our favorite place to eat was chipotle and we’d have it at least once a week. We got chipotle for dinner one night and I woke up around 2am with the most nauseating, excruciating stomach cramps known to man. I brushed it off thinking it was my period or something along those lines but it continued to get worse and worse throughout the night. I decided to go to the bathroom and realized I could barely stand so I crawled to the bathroom and ran myself a bath thinking that might help. Around 4am I decided that it wasn’t going to get better on its own and called my dad to take me to the ER. Test after test, the doctor couldn’t find anything wrong with me. I got pain meds and some sleep and was sent home. Two more trips to the ER, some accusations of med seeking and an aversion to morphine, before the doctor ordered yet another ultrasound. Gallstones. I had gallstones at 15 years old. I am now 18, gallbladder-less, and can’t stand to eat chipotle!",Tried to off myself with acetaminophen and ended up with gallstones at the ripe age of 15,I ate chipotle and had gallstones.
"TIFU by telling my BFF she gave me the ick
So my friend is pretty much a soulmate, we've been vibing for a long time - met on the first day of secondary school and tight ever since. Yeah we kissed the same boys but we always knew the real deal was our friendship. And we've been there for each other through some crazy break-ups, some family drama, moving countries, failing exams and countless hangovers. I love this woman with all my heart and I would never want to hurt her. Ever. 

So she's a little insecure about fashion and what to wear - she's an alternative gal and me too more or less. We've hopped on the dungaree train together a few years ago, I got off around about pinafore dress and she's riding it all the way to...cowboy town.

So she's sending some pics of new dungarees into our lil group chat when shabam there's one funny picture with her tipping a cowboy hat to the camera - goofy face and all - I had a giggle and immediately responded that she looked great and I loved the new dungarees but the cowboy hat gave me the ick. Assuming it was an old hat lying around the house...

Nope.

That was the ONLY thing she bought on that shopping trip and she was excited to show us all. Face-flippin-palm. I was still laughing and feeling good for like 3 minutes and then I realised I had literally said to her: 'that one thing you got? I hate it' damn. Feeling bad about telling my bestie she's got bad taste in hats but feeling like backing out now would make it too serious! Eek.

"TIFU by showing my grandfather my husband naked
So my cat broke her leg really badly, in three places and she needed emergency surgery. I couldn't afford it even if I sold everything I owned. It took us forever to even find a surgeon that could do the operation but luckily we managed to find one that was local and was charging a reasonable price (one place quoted us £6000). But we still couldn't afford it so i asked my grandfather for help. Him being the hero he is offered straight away to pay for it and didn't even want me to pay it back.

So the day after her surgery he video calls me to ask how she's doing. I pan the camera over to her to show him her all shaved and her cast which had a cute little heart on it. Completely not thinking about the fact that between me and the cat is my naked husband. Luckily his penis was between his legs so at least my grandfather didn't see that. My grandfather didn't say anything about what he saw but there's no way he didn't see my naked husband.

"TIFU by messing up my solo at the biggest contest of the year
For context, my school band has been preparing for the most important ensemble evaluation/contest of the year for about 3 months. One of our songs has a very simple flute solo at the very beginning. Throughout the perhaps 30 times I’ve played this solo, I haven’t messed it up (there’s always room for improvement but I’ve never technically messed up). There must’ve been some sort of jinx because right before the contest, my friend said, “You’ve never messed up your solo.” and I was like, “This better not be the one time I do!” 

So anyways, we start performing the piece and I came in a count early and cracked two notes. I was mortified. The band recovered, but our director came off the podium after the song to tell me not to worry about it. However, it’s like the easiest solo ever, so I messed up the only things I COULDVE messed up.

After the performance, we went to the gym and our director informed us that we got the highest score possible. However, she told me to come up to the front and started talking about my mistake and how well the band recovered. She literally singled me out by name and I had to sheepishly walk to the front 😭. Thankfully, she was really nice about it and told me I still sounded good (even though I didn’t).",Messed up an easy solo at the most important contest of the year. Extremely embarrassing but we still got the highest possible score.,I messed up my solo at the biggest ensemble contest of the year and got the highest score possible.
"TIFU by sending a voice note i meant to delete, to someone who wasn’t supposed to hear it
after the breakup, i made a quiet little rule for myself:  
no emotional oversharing.  
no late-night “maybe i still miss him” texts.  
no giving the past more airtime than it deserves.

but yesterday… i slipped.

i was sending a voice note to a friend. we’ve started doing that instead of texting.

* someone in tesco was wearing the same hoodie my ex used to steal from me.
* i passed the lego aisle (he broke mine, long story).
* then our song came on in a cafe like the universe just wanted to be annoying.

so i’m midway through this ramble when i say: 

“i don’t miss him. i miss the girl i was before he made me doubt myself.”

it wasn’t even meant to be deep. just… a passing thought.

"TIFU- I sent nudes to my good male friend
My male friend and I have known each other for about a year now. We became close just in the past couple of months. I always felt there was something between us but never knew if he felt that way. Last Saturday he was giving me compliments on my outfit and hair and told me he’d take me hunting with him sometime(he was drinking  when he told me he’d take me hunting ) We started snapping-nothing dirty and he told me that if he gets drunk I can’t snap him because he doesn’t want to ask me for tiddy pics. I agreed ( he told me this like 2 weeks ago) 
but then this past Saturday he got drunk and told me he’d have to let me go but he kept snapping me he told me he’d have to enjoyed my company and to not leave the convo. He ended up asking me and I ended up giving him the pic. But what is most embarrassing is I sent him my hooha and that’s not what he meant. He said he liked it and to not be embarrassed and then called me a sweetheart since I said thank you. 
I’m still super embarrassed about it and hope it doesn’t ruin what we have. We discussed having sex but agreed we didn’t want to because we don’t want to fuck up what we have. He also said we don’t need me falling in love so I am still confused about that. He hasn’t snapped me and I’m scared he’s beating himself up over it bc he was beating himself up over drinking.

"TIFU by staring at an actress' thighs
I was watching a movie with my gf and her 8 year old son. Two characters were around a campfire, a woman standing and a man sitting down. The camera angle changed and it showed the back of the woman who was wearing a pretty short skirt. 

Her son goes ""ahh a butt"" and covered his eyes. The skirt was short and you saw her thighs but no butt. 

The camera angle changes again then goes back and he has the same reaction. ""Ahhh butt"" and covers his eyes. I speak up and tell him ""it's just her legs dude, it's okay"" 

And he goes ""no the guy's butt!""

"TIFU by flirting with my friend and meeting her long-term boyfriend at the worst possible moment
This happened earlier today and I’m still recovering.

I saw my best friend (let’s call her S) sitting alone in our campus cafe, so I went over to hang out. We were chatting, laughing, and as usual I was throwing in some over-the-top flirty jokes. Nothing serious, just our dynamic. S knows I’m not actually hitting on her, and we’ve always joked like that.

She’s been dating her boyfriend, D, for about 3 years. It’s long-distance, and I’d never met him before, just heard a lot about him.

Anyway, we’re mid-convo, and I end up saying (completely unserious, joking tone):

“DAMN THAT ASS FAT LEMME GET SOME UH THAT”

Yes. I know. Probably not the best thing to say in a public location, but it made sense in context and we both laughed, until someone behind S starts dying laughing. Like full-on, can’t breathe, tears in his eyes kind of laughing.

I look up and go, “Uhh… who are you?” in a pretty judgmental tone because I thought it was some random guy listening in.

S turns around, laughs, and goes:

“That’s my boyfriend. D, meet my friend A.”

My soul left my body.

This man’s first impression of me was hearing me say that out loud to his girlfriend. I just said “Hi” and tried to disappear. Meanwhile, D is still wiping tears from his face and goes:

“That was so funny. Couldn’t have said it better myself.”

And then we all just lost it again. But internally, I was dying. I have no idea how long he’d been standing there, I didn't even notice him. There’s a real chance he heard the whole lead-up, the jokes, the insane shit I said before that, everything. 

Anyway. Pretty sure I’m now “Fat Ass Girl” in this man’s memory forever. S definitely set me up, I'm sure she knew he was there, and I will never emotionally recover.","I fake-flirted with my best friend in public, dropped an outrageous line about her ass, and then learned her long-distance boyfriend (who I’d never met) was standing right behind her.

"TIFU by telling a stupid joke
On Monday, I (42F) went on probably the best date of my entire life. We'll call him great date guy (48M). I met him on Tinder and decided to meet for dinner near my apartment. He brought the most amazing energy to the date, we laughed, adhd vibing (both of us have it), and it was just the most amazing time. He came back to my place, we both agreed to keep things out of the bedroom and take things slow. I agreed, no problem. The night ended with amazing kisses and plans to see each other again on Friday. 

Now, before the date, I asked great date guy to come to me because I went on 2 dates with someone who told me he couldn't come to me because he's broke. I drove an hour one way for 2 dates and make half of what he makes a yr (or so he said, who knows). Anyway, the great date guy agreed to come to me. 

So, Tuesday, we've been texting when we could all day, because we're at work etc because he'd planned the date for Friday. He had mentioned on Monday that he would like to see me again before Friday if possible. So Tuesday, I asked if he wanted to meet again before Friday. To which he said he wouldn't have his car until Fri. And cue my stupid fucking sense of humor. Here's where I fucked everything up. Because we'd had so much fun, vibing, great banter, etc, I thought it would be a good joke to say ""if you're gonna be like that other guy, i might have to rethink this situation."" He texted back saying ""Ugh. I understand. No hard feelings I wish you the very best."" I immediately text back saying I can come to him, but he'd already blocked me.

"TIFU by tanking an interview due to a joke.
Had an interview for a media manager role within a relatively small company, it wasn't my dream job but it certainly would have done for the time and the company itself seemed to have good reviews and a good reputation online. 

I go there and meet with the two interviewers, a guy and a girl, and from the start it's a very casual and friendly vibe.

The interview goes fantastically, I have a good answer for every question, I ask questions that impress them and make them realise I'm serious and have done my research.

Above all however, this interview, while going well, is full of banter. The three of us are just straight vibing, laughing, smiling, firing jokes out there, the body language is as relaxed as it gets.

We get to the end of the interview and they throw in right at the last minute, 'Now this is just a fun little question we're asking the candidates, if you were an animal, what animal do you think you would be?'.

I'm not expecting the question so I panic a bit and say the first animal that comes to mind, and I say, 'Oh, probably an owl'.

They ask me why and I panic again because I really just threw an animal out there but I regained myself and said 'Well, like the owl, I think people who knew me would consider me  a wise person, plus when it comes to my work I have 20/20 vision'

They really liked these answers I could see, and I'm thinking, I have absolutely smashed this interview, there is no possible way I can lose at this point. So, I throw in one last joke, 'Plus, I like to hunt and eat mice at night'.

The entire atmosphere changed, their body language changed, they're not smiling anymore. They go, 'Oh, okay.. well thanks for coming in, we'll be in touch soon to let you know the outcome', I say it was just a joke, I was adding on to the own thing from before, they don't care. 

I never even heard back from them to say I was rejected, within two seconds I destroyed an interview. In my defense however I will say I do feel a bit cheated, because the tone of the entire interview led me to believe they would appreciate the humour.",I tanked a job interview after it went well by telling a stupid joke about owls.,TIFU by tanking an interview due to a joke.
"TIFU by mistaking someone for a homeless man
I went to a weed shop today and I noticed sitting in the corner near the door was an old wizened man who appeared to be somewhat blind. There is a huge homeless population here and I figured maybe this shop was just letting him hang out inside. I’ve seen that before. 

As I was leaving I went to give him a dollar but he just kinda shifted away from me and didn’t reply and stood up. I then went to put the dollar in his bag and I realized he was a customer and had purchased weed. At the same time the shop clerk was like uh he’s just waiting for a cab. 

I felt like a total piece of shit and still do. I essentially was harassing this old dude who was minding his own business.",mistook a customer for a homeless person and tried to force a dollar upon him,I mistook an old homeless man for a homeless man.
"TIFU by accidently defending racism?
Actually today, believe it or not.

I was talking with a friend about cosmetics and brought up Jeffree Star and the Dramageddon. They said they remembered his MySpace days, and he's always been problematic. I said that ""edgy and controversial is his whole brand."" They said ""There's a difference between edgy and racist.""
Now, here's where I take a wrong turn. I try to discuss the nuance of edge, and the difference between counter-culture culture and contrarian trolls. And I get a little verbose. So I apologize for coming across as overzealous. But because I didn't address the aspect of racism, I realized it might have looked like one side was edgy, the other racist. 
So I uttered the phrase ""not defending racists, just defining edge."" They respond with ""If you ever have to start a sentence with 'not defending racists'... good luck"" and blocked me. Bruh... I'm literally not defending racists. I was trying to have a conversation about punk activism in society at large and how it is used to promote equity, equality, and inclusion. So now I'm sitting here alone, wondering how to phrase it better in the future.","- TIFU by being responding to a comment about racism with a separate topic and then saying ""I'm not defending racists, ...""

"TIFU by accidentally ruining the walls of my bathroom because if 2 bees (i think) and now i gotta repaint it

TIFU by accidentally ruining the walls in my bathroom because of two bees, and now I gotta repaint them.

I was just shitting normally when I suddenly heard two buzzes at the window. I saw two bees half stuck there; I don’t know how they got in. I laughed at them, but then one of them got out. I immediately zipped up my pants and ran out of the bathroom because I’m allergic (not deadly) to bee stings.

I felt extra brave today, so I went to look for something to kill it with, but I found nothing except a random spray. I grabbed the spray in one hand and a sick-smelling spray in the other because I thought it would keep them away from me. I turned on the lights and opened the doors, and saw both bees on the floor, but they were kinda far away. I didn’t want to get close, so I decided to snipe them from a distance.

I missed, so I just sprinted to the door and turned off the lights again. At this point, it had been five minutes, and I really needed to wipe, so I decided to risk it. I went back into the room fully prepared and just sprayed them for like three minutes straight. I kept missing until they made a blunder and got into my previous missed shots, and both died.

To my horror, the walls changed color, and now I have to repaint them, which really sucks because they were in good shape.","I was shitting and then saw two bees with me, so I grabbed a random spray and a sick-smelling hair spray to extinguish them.

"TIFU by letting my sister see the seasonal anime in my phone
I use myanimelist (MAL) to keep track of the anime I watch. Today my sister and I met to watch some anime together as we often do on weekends. We had just finished watching the last episode for the day, so I pulled my phone to mark the episode. The anime we were watching is a seasonal. She asked me how I knew the name of the anime since I found it before she gave me the name, but she had mentioned to me some details of the synopsis earlier. I replied that it was not hard to narrow down among the seasonal anime in the app. She was like, ""wait, how do you see that in MAL"". I responded that it says right below in the navigation bar under ""seasonal"". Then I go further and pulled my phone up to her and said, ""look, right here. You can even see past seasons and filter with different options"".

Then she asked, ""oh, can I see. My phone is charging so I cannot check in mine"". In that instant a million thoughts went through my head. I immediately remember all the ones I have added to plan to watch and the ones I am watching. A couple of them are of... uhm... questionable taste if you know what I mean. Stupidly in that moment I thought three conflicting things:

1. ""if I say no it is going to be too suspicious. I have no excuse."" She's asked me in the past to add her as friend but I have dodged the topic ""tactfully""
2. ""well, it's not like I am watching every single thing in the list, right?"" Me stupidly forgetting that it shows right there in the corner what you are watching
3. ""I already thought it for too long (about a second), I better answer yes or no right now."" This was the nail in the coffin.

I just said ""sure"", and immediately regretted it as she started scrolling down and I saw in the corner the dark-gray marks for plant-to-watch and _bright fucking green_ for currently watching. I am trying to think she did not see it, but she isn't dumb and the freaking thumbnails of those ""unsavory"" entries are too outrageous to ignore seeing them. Either way, she just kept scrolling and commenting normally on the ones that she remembered while I was yelling at the top of my lungs inside my head trying to keep sanity on the outside.

So yeah, she knows, but she did not make a single comment about it. So right now I will just bury my head in the ground, and hope that I don't put myself in these situations in the future. Why did I have to open my mouth in the first place. I could have just mentioned it instead of showing it like a dumbass in my phone. Oh well...","Handed my phone to my sister to see the seasonal anime in myanimelist.

"TIFU by joining the Mormon church
So my friend is a devout Mormon and he invited me to church. I went a few times everybody was really nice and over all I enjoyed it.

I told them that I was sexually assulted when young just to justify where that came from.

"TIFU by giving back my engagement ring to my fiancé and telling him to get out of my house
So I (27f) was engaged to a (29m) we will call him O, we've been engaged for a year and our wedding was set to be in october. 

Yesterday him and i picked out furniture for our new home ,then he came to spend the night with me. It started super friendly and we were joking and taking about our future home, one thing led to another (the joking) and he escalated it by throwing a tissue box at me. Tissue box hit me square in the face and i saw red, i started throwing all kinds of stuff at him and he kept laughing, he then handed me a tissue implying that i wipe my tears that were about to fall , he knew i felt mad but he kept laughing, so i told him to get out of my house and his laughter subsided but didn't budge.

In my rage i threw a box of cookies at him and it scattered everywhere, so he ignored my requests for him to leave and started picking up the cookies, i felt awful for the rage episode but i couldn't shake it off, and before i knew what i was doing i went to my room and took out my ring box, put the ring in it and slammed it on the table in front of him. He then called my dad and dad came, calmed me and him down, took th ring box out of my hand and kept it with him , and he told us to wait until we have calmed down to make a calculated decision. 

Today my ex fiancé called my dad and told him that it's over and he couldn't get past this rage episode. And now I'm collecting his stuff to give back to him.

"TIFU
As a kid in kindegarten I liked this girl who was from another group. We would usually be lined up in pairs before going out of the building anywhere. And in our culture it is a norm to show someone as an example to others. And there were a boy and a girl who were always pointed at by elders to say be like them. It always annoyed me that we were treated in such a way as to make us compare ourselves and measure up to them.

So one day we were for some reason being lined up with another group where this girl was and I was like this is my chance to be with her and to be cool and popular and an example to others. Usually we'd line up and I remember I left my pair and ran up to her to stand next to her and there is this boy who comes out and says we are a pair and I was like no I am gonna be with her. Then, he starts explaining like that they usually are together or something. I get really mad as I was so jealous of her. I swing to punch him... hitting the girl. I don't remember if she stepped in front or something, but once I swung I did not see what I was hitting. At that moment the time has kind of stopped I think I got into a sort of an autopilot. Screams, the teachers, students, parents, moms, everyone. I barely remeber anything in the next 2 weeks. Everyone would point to me, or whisper/talk about me, I would be aggressive in response to any one talking about me. Breaking down easily. I'd shake when getting near the kindergarten. But weirdly my memory I think got cut off at some point cus at some point everyone just seeminly moved on. But I do remember being called by some moms a girl-beater and all sorts of things. Traumatised me for lots of coming years. Whenever I'd get in a fight, I'd start having a panic attack, shake etc. As I got into teenage years I remember getting over it. But whenever I have to deal with anxiety I still feel that feeling within me. Those cold winter days, being an outcast, hated, etc.
TL:DR:
I got into a fight over a girl in kindergarten thought we'd be a popular couple, hit her in process by mistake, got outcasted for whole 2 weeks (which lasts long for a kid) was traumatised for a while",,"I got in a fight with a girl in kindergarten, got outcasted for 2 weeks, was called a girl-beater for a while."
"TIFU by allowing myself to get sexually exploited
I (16 turning 17) basically downloaded a random chat-type app called Addchat and I was basically just chilling not really in the mood for anything frisky. I mainly connected with a few male guys and I was just chatting with them about minecraft or cod:m. I did connect with a few females but it was for the same reason and neither of us actually delved into anything sexual until I connected with a 'girl' named Helen.

She basically just asked hru and stuff like that and I gave the typical nthing much wbu reponses until she asked me if I wanted to chat thru Telegram. I didn't really catch onto anything but I agreed since I did have Telegram and I hadn't used it in months so I figured why not.  
  
In telegram, she asked the same hru, i gave the same response, yada yada and then she asked if I was alone. I mean I was so I said yea and she asked how I looked. I wasn't really trusting this person so I asked her to send a pic of herself to prove she wasn't trynna pull something and she did send a pic so I sent one of mine. She proceeded to ask if I wanted to trade nudes with her on Instagram cuz u can't screenshot or save posts and that lit up my tiny little teenage male brain and i instantly said K and I dropped my @. 

She was a new account on Insta so I got suspicious feelings again so I told her that i won't be sending anything unless she sends first and I backed that up with the fact her account was created THIS MONTH. After a few back and forth messages, she gave in and sent a pic so I sent one back. After this, she asked me to msg her back on Telegram and that is where she started saying how she will reveal the pics to all my followers, friends and family unless I sent them a 5$ Steam giftcard.

I legit felt my body go cold and I didn't know what the heck to do cause I don't have any physical giftcards, its 3 am, and I don't have any online accounts or digital money to purchase or send anything to this account so I contacted a few discord friends all the while this person was demanding for a gift card. None of my discord friends could purchase anything for me cuz they also don't have online money so I screenshotted the entire chat on Telegram: kellamor001 , blocked and reported their Insta: susan\_hellen245. This person was actually impersonating a 17 year old girl. 

I called the authorities for reporting this but they had told me to visit a physical police centre with my dad that is almost an hour drive away (although they were helpful and told me to cease contact with this person and they were understanding despite my age)  and i just don't know how to bring myself to tell my dad something like this happened to me all cuz i felt lustful at 3am. 

It's been a few hours after the person's 'demand deadline' and i don't see any signs that shows that they have shared my photos (all",,"Met a girl through a random chat app, she asked me to chat thru telegram, asked me if I was alone, i gave the same answer, asked her to send me nudes, she sent them back on telegram and I dropped my @.

"TIFU because I tried to be the ""cool dad""
My oldest son, who's 15, has had trouble making friends for a lot of his life, but since the start of the school year he has become very close with 2 other kids in his grade, which my wife and I are extremely happy about. We've been very supportive of him fostering these friendships, which has included taking him to their houses and hosting them at ours, letting him have sleepovers with them, taking them to museums, movies. and stores they want to visit/see, stuff like that. 

A little while ago (yes, the actual fuck-up didn't happen today, but I did only find out about it today) my son had a sleepover with his friends. They all stayed in the living room while my wife and I stayed in our bedroom all night and our younger two sons were staying over with their friends. Once both of my son's friends were here, I told my son that he could feel free to use my card to order dinner and even rent a movie or something if he and his friends wanted. 

He and his friends were clearly happy with that, and he said ""Really?"" and I said yes, he could order what they wanted and watch whatever. Now, I expected them to order pizza, maybe get dessert and breadsticks with it, and probably not need to pay for a movie as we have plenty of streaming services, and even if he did need to pay for something, I expected it to be maybe one rental on Prime that might cost $4 or so.

"TIFU by trying to eat dinner with mustard.
This is as bad as it can be I assure you. No, nobody got hurt, lets just say my clumsy self made a mistake.

It's about 4:30 in the afternoon, me my uncle and grandparents often eat dinner early especially cuz uncle works at like 6. We get homecooked food from this local place just up the road, when we eat out we usually eat from there. Nothing too crazy.

We all get big burgers fries and onion rings, but here is the start of the problem. The place doesnt put sauces on our burgers as its an extra charge for condiments (i mean what are you gonna do, eh) so we just use what we have at home. 

Im in the kitchen getting knives and forks for my grandparents as well as drinks, and they all use the condiments, right? Issue is I thought they closed the lids to the bottles. Ketchup, okay. Bbq sauce, okay. Hot sauce, okay. Mustard, yeahhhhhhhhhhh no.

I sit down and start dressing up my burger. I get to the mustard, feel that it hadnt been shaken up, so I go to shake it, and the loose lid opens up. And i sling mustard across the floor and house. And right on my uncles work clothes, my dogs back, the glass door, my own leg, and even into the hallway.

Since you all seemed to like yesterday's one so much, here's another one. I love wine, and two years ago I drank it in my bedroom. I then placed it on the bedside table (which is next to my face) and fell asleep. 3 in the morning, I wake up to an almighty crash, blood and pieces of glass everywhere. I had 6 deep cuts on my chest and one shallow one on my eyelid. I then got up, went to A&E (basically an ER here in England) and waited for stitches while holding tissues to my wounds. After 5 hours  (A&E is known for very, very long wait times) some nurses come out and take me in. They inspect the cuts and find that there is shards of glass inside them.

"TIFU by yelling ""THEY HAD SEX"" in a Zoom meeting with my boss and coworkers
This is something that actually just happened an hour ago. I work completely remote and had a weekly zoom meeting with my boss and 7 other coworkers (with varying levels of authority) and they were talking about something rather important. Now, before you judge me super hard, I actually have my Zoom settings set up to automatically mute when entering meetings. I usually keep it on mute at all times unless I need to talk. This meeting was a little different because I needed to give my input on the topic, so when I joined the meeting, I decided to unmute (big mistake).

My wife and I recently decided that we would get a dog via a dog breeder - we had already put down a deposit for a puppy. The parents of our future puppy had yet to mate but today that changed when the dog breeder posted on their Facebook page announcing that the parents have successfully mated. Unfortunately, English is NOT my wife's first language, so when she read the post on her phone on the other side of the room, she immediately asked me what ""mated"" means. Without a second thought, I yelled to her ""THEY HAD SEX"". The meeting goes quite for a second and my boss laughs. My heart drops, and I quickly look at my computer screen to see if it was unmuted. The microphone did not have the red slash across it. I could feel the blood rush to my face and in a flash I clicked the button to mute my microphone.

After my boss finished laughing, they continue the meeting as if nothing happened. My wife and I share a laugh about it but it is easily one of the most embarrassing moments in my life. Yes, I am aware that I'm lucky that this is one of my worst moments - i know it could be so much worse. Writing this out made me feel better though.

TL:DR: I yelled ""THEY HAD SEX"" to my wife who did not know what the word ""mate"" means because English is not her first language while on a Zoom meeting and my boss and coworkers heard me.",,"I yelled ""THEY HAD SEX"" in a Zoom meeting and my boss and coworkers heard me."
"TIFU by kissing my best friend
Okay, so, I (f17) kissed my best friend (f18) the other night. I'll call her Beth for this story. We had both spent a night at a party but neither of us had been drinking. I was on driving duty for some of my other friends and she kept me company while everyone else was drunk. (For reference she doesn't really like parties anyways)

So the night went on, me and her were just hanging out and talking, everything was normal. And eventually it was getting late and everyone needed a ride home. In our usual fashion when I'm designated driver we stopped at McDonald's and everyone got food. Beth forgot her card and so I offered to pay, it wasn't strange for us to cover each other when it came to small things like food. But then one of our more brash friends who likes to say the first thing that comes to his head made a joke about how I should give him tips on how to treat a girl right. Beth and I laughed it off but that joke clearly added tension to the air. I kind of felt off for the rest of the time we were there. 

After everyone finished eating, I started dropping them all off at their houses. Even though Beth lived close to where we were, I waited to drop her off, simply because she kept me sane with all those annoying drunk people around. I didn't tell her that was what I was doing, but we just shared a look and she knew. When everyone else was home and I was on the way to Beth's house I made an off-handed comment about not wanting to go home (due to some parental things that Beth knows all about). She was kind enough to offer for me to stay at her place, including that I could borrow her pjs and a change of clothes in the morning.

We were at Beth's place and I was using the spare toothbrush I keep at her house when she started talking about the comment our friend made earlier in McDonald's. She said that I did treat her better than any other guys she'd known. She then make a joke that I'd make really good boyfriend material. She kept looking at me and pausing and I wasn't quite sure if it was a hint or not. But after I rinsed my toothbrush I leaned over and kissed her. I'd never kissed anyone before and neither had she, but it felt right, like it wasn't awkward.

Then everything went downhill. I started panicking about the implications of what that kiss would mean for our friendship and our friend group as a whole. I pulled away and stared at her with the most kind of 'oh shit' look ever. And she had a matching expression on her face. She was maybe about to say something but I blurted out, ""Yeah I should just go home tonight probably"" instead. She nodded and agreed. I didn't give back her pjs, I just left. Went home. 

That was a few nights ago. I thought maybe she'd text me, but it's been radio silence. I was going to text her but I wouldn't know what to say. This is probably the longest we've gone without sending a single text and it feels weird. Last night I went and hung out with some friends, she was suppose to be there but canceled last minute saying she felt under the weather. I think she canceled because she knew I was going to be there. I don't what to do but I know I fucked up. Either by actually kissing her or deciding to leave afterwards.","I kissed my best friend after she made a few jokes about me and her, then left right after because I got scared. Now she might be avoiding me. 

UPDATE: 
I don't really know how to properly update so maybe no one is going to see this and that's fine. 

I texted Beth and asked if we could meet up for lunch today, she agreed and we went. She asked me why exactly I kissed her and I didn't quite have an answer. We talked for a while (I actually think the waiter was getting sick of how long we were sitting there for). She ended up saying that she had some kind of feelings for me but didn't really understand them all at, and I echoed that same remark. We ended up deciding to keep it under wraps for now to prevent any kind of complications with our friend ground, but either way we both know that the other cares deeply and wants to at least stay friends if things get too complicated. So I guess we're just taking things as they are and talking out any kind of issues that develop.",I (f17) kissed my best friend (f18) the other night and it felt right.
"TIFU by forgetting I had an ant exterminator appointment
So for context, I (30 F) live alone in my best friend's house while she is spending a couple years teaching in China. I get rent control and the place to myself when she's working most of the year. She gets a full time house watcher who notices when ants start coming out of a crack in the second/my bathroom shower tile. We live in Texas, so we pay for an exterminator company to come out every 6 months for routine treatments and they'll come out for any additional issues that pop up like this.

Great. Problem is, the ants pop up right before I am selected for jury duty. The trial is supposed to last at least a week, so I schedule someone to come out two weeks later to be safe, then promptly absolutely forget about it. At first, I had to spray RAID a few times, but then the ants stopped popping up. I also didn't put the appointment in my calendar so of course to my ADHD brain, nothing ever happened.

Today, doorbell rings, I look at my door camera, 'oh yeah, totally forgot I scheduled that, let me actually answer my door for once.' Exterminator guy is very pleasant. After a couple minutes chatting about the ants, he gets some supplies and I let him in the house. We pass through the living and I happen to have my favorite YouTuber playing REPO on the big TV. As I lead the way around the corner into the bathroom, two things happen at once.

He says, ""Oh REPO! I heard about that game. Is it any good?"" I enter the bathroom and see MY GLASS DILDO CHILLING OUT ON THE COUNTER FOR ANYONE TO SEE. Dude is 3 steps behind me and based on his voice is literally rounding the corner about to enter full view of the bathroom.

I absolutely freak for 0.5 seconds. Then I lock the fuck in. The dildo's clean, so I grab it to cover as much of it from his view as possible, mostly with my forearm. Thankfully, I'm wearing an oversized half-zip sweater with one of those giant kangaroo pockets in the front. While I'm turning and stuffing it in my pocket as quickly as possible, I say ""Well, I've only ever seen YouTubers play it, since I don't actually have the game myself. But every video I've seen looks super fun. Anyways, here's where the ants were coming in!""

Don't ask me if that's exactly what I said. My adrenaline was going so bad, I could have absolutely botched what I intended to say and spit garbage. Whether or not I made any sense, whether or not guy actually saw the dildo or I'm actually sneak level 100, I have no idea. Because dude acts like nothing is wrong.

He confirms what gel/spray thing he's going to use and says it should take care of the issue perfectly. I say ""great!!"" and book it out of the bathroom to my bedroom ASAP. I hide my shame underneath my pillow, then shoo to the open living room/kitchen to look busy and innocent. He spends a few minutes doing his job. When he comes out he makes some pleasant conversation that AGAIN seems he has no clue what I just did. He happened to notice my friend's taekwondo trophy (the thing's taller than I am and by the TV) and he also happens to do mixed martial arts on the side, so we chat some more.

While I am a little embarrassed about the whole thing, at this point I mostly just find it hilarious. Even if he did see the dildo, as long as he's chill about it (which he absolutely is) I really don't care what this stranger knows or what he thinks about me because of it. Dude says he hopes we see each other at a big tournament some day and goes on his way. I close the door and spend the day laughing at my own dumb-assery.

As consequnce free as the interaction was, it was a great reminder to keep better track of my appointments from now on!",I forgot that I had scheduled an exterminator to come check out my bathroom where ants were popping up as well as the glass dildo I had left on the bathroom counter.,TIFU by forgetting I had an ant exterminator appointment.
"TIFU by telling my boss’s driver to pick him up at the wrong time
I am a brand new EA. I’m about a month into this new job with no prior experience as an EA but that does not excuse this mistake. It’s not like it’s something I needed to learn or be trained in. I just made a stupid mistake when arranging for pick up for my boss at the airport. I accidentally gave the driver the departure time of the flight instead of the arrival time, so the driver waited 4 hours. My boss was changing his schedule around a lot and went back and forth with changes to the time of flight and I was probably overwhelmed and just messed up. I feel so stupid and my boss was pissed and really put me down for it. 

Everyone always says that mistakes are for learning but what is there to really learn? I already know what I’m supposed to do. And I do already check trip details multiply times. And somehow I still messed up. This is the second big, dumb mistake I’ve made and I’m afraid if I make another he will fire me.",feeling incredibly stupid for telling my boss’s driver to pick him up from the airport 4 hours too early,TIFU by telling my boss's driver to pick him up at the wrong time.
"TIFU by not helping a coworker who was getting beat.
I work at a very popular fast food chain (to save myself from potentially doxxing myself i’m not gonna name which one). I started just a little over a week ago now so when i tell you i was NOT prepared for this i wasn’t so let me give a little background: I’m an 18M, i still am technically training so i work directly under whoever i’m scheduled with that day and the manager. So this day I’m working with a guy, lets call him Jamal (yes that name is intentional, I’m black as well) and presumably his wife, let’s call her Samantha. So basically leading up to this moment, it’s after my break and we’re wrapping up for the day doing closing work, and i can tell their vibes are a really weird the moment i come back from break. I tried to keep a distance while also keeping an eye on them, because i have a sort of past with this kind of thing, that is unstable relationships being broadcasted out and making me super uncomfortable (my parents but they are long since divorced and separated). I keep hearing them go back and forth over something really trivial, they were arguing over something that Samantha had said to him that presumably upset him, he wasn’t having any of it and he was just shouting “get away from be bruh” “I don’t want to even look at you right now” and things like that. Now anyone with a brain would obviously recognize those two lines as extremely unhealthy, you don’t push away your partner during a disagreement. So at this point i’m really uneasy, still trying to keep my distance all while continuing to do my job. And sometime after all the verbal commotion, thats when i hear things hitting other things, and like anyone, i went towards the noise to check what was creating all of it, and that’s when i see Jamal putting his hands on her. He grabbed her, pushed her into a shelf, i literally saw her rebound off the shelf, he grabs her and PUSHES HER AGAIN. I look at this exchange for maybe 2 seconds, i’m frozen not knowing what to do, and i actually just turn around. I didn’t step in, i didn’t separate them, hell i probably could’ve even defended her by hitting him with some kind of kitchen blunt object and i would’ve completely been in the right and i STILL didn’t do anything, i just turned my ass right back around and pretended like i didn’t see anything. I know they both saw me look at the dispute, because Samantha ended up removing herself and leaving. I feel so bad for not doing anything. When i later when to go take out the trash for the night, she was sitting near the dumpster just crying. My heart burns for her and i just cannot believe anyone with a heart can put hands on their significant other. When i spoke with her at the dumpster she BEGGED me not to tell anyone. Look at me going against her wishes. Reddit, what do I do? I know she’s the type that won’t report it. She’s the type that’ll take the abuse because “that’s her man” and I’m sick just thinking about if that’s what he’ll do at work in front of other people, just imagine what she might go through at home. Before anyone says anything: Yes i reported it to the closing manager working that night, No she isn’t going to do anything about it (because she didn’t see it, are you kidding me??), and no the cameras didn’t pick it up because the dispute happened in the back where there isn’t a camera. I don’t have any concrete evidence to give a police statement besides Samantha alone, but again, “that’s her man” and i’m not sure if she’d even testify against him. All i know is, if i see that happen in front of me again, I’m not staying idle.",I saw a domestic dispute between two coworkers and didn’t do anything about it and now feel super guilty.,"Worked with a coworker who was getting beat up, i didn’t help her, he grabbed her and pushed her into a shelf, i saw her rebound off the shelf."
"TIFU - I brought back a colleague the CEO didn't want
I work in an office with multiple people. It's a seasonal kind of work, meaning we peak in the summer months and need more employees then.

It's a multi-language company, and you need to speak at least 3 languages to be considered for a job. We had a lot of issues finding employees, but for the last 2 seasons, we have been a solid group of 5 people (3 males, 2 females, ages 28-40). And it's been great! No bitching, no ""office drama"" - just pure bliss and a great team, as long as no customer disturbs our peace :-)

I work full time and ""get"" one colleague to stay with me the whole year round. I'm usually not involved in the hiring process whatsoever. From October 2022 to October 2024, I had a male colleague, let's call him Shaggy (28), and we got along GREAT. Because of bureaucracy issues, we couldn't offer him a longer contract; at least, that's what I thought. 

My female colleague, Daphne, got a 1-year contract in October 2024, and Shaggy was told to feel free to call if he's still job hunting in May 2025. The 3 of us still hang out from time to time.

Now that the season is getting closer, my new supervisor started searching for new employees for other departments in our company and I started panicking. Since I've been working for over 10 years in this office, I'm the one who has to train the new employee, and believe you me - I do not want to do that anymore.

I knew that Shaggy hadn't found a new job, and apart from his bumped ego (he was hoping for a longer contract), he would actually be interested in getting back to our office. As the name suggests, he's a laid-back (scaredy-cat) kinda guy, so if he doesn't have to learn skills for a new job, he's on board.

So, I started ""lobbying"" - telling the new supervisor (31) how great of a team we were, that we work well together, no beef, great teamwork, and also Shaggy is still searching for a job. I urged him to talk with HR and the old supervisor (30) and see if we could get him back or at least start searching for a new hire ASAP so we have someone before Easter.

I also talked with Shaggy about it, and he was OK with my actions. I kept going, reminding other departments about the good time we had in the summer, including Shaggy in the stories, one way or another.

**It worked! They called him and offered him the summer job last week.** I was very pleased with myself, and the team was happy - we're all looking forward to be working together again!

This week, the CEO (60) came to visit. He talked with HR, and I got the note that **he's VERY upset that we hired Shaggy again..** It seems that a lot of customers complained about Shaggy, and the CEO did NOT want him back. That was the real reason his contract was terminated. The CEO was hoping for a new, fresh hire.

Worth mentioning:

* I knew that we got complaints, but we get them all the time, so I didn't think much about it. Did people complain about Shaggy? Yeah, but they complained much more about Trevor, another summer employee who's coming back for his 4 year in a row, and it was never discussed to find a replacement for him!
* I also knew that the old supervisor had some issues with Shaggy. But I was under the impression that it was more due to personal character differences than work. The old supervisor is a perfectionist. Since he's still training the new supervisor, I was sure he would object if he really didn't want Shaggy to come back or if he knew something I don't. I was wrong. The old supervisor is changing departments and it seems that he couldn't give a damn about what's happening to our office. So, he let the new supervisor call Shaggy and offer him the job. At least, that's the story I I got.
* I did not lie about Shaggy's work in the company. He made mistakes, but who doesn't? But, perhaps I sugarcoated it a bit too much for the new supervisor...
* The CEO is an ass, and often exaggerates to get his point across. If 2 customers complain, he'll say ""a lot"". But if he likes you, he'll say ""that is negligible"". It's unsure how trustworthy his words are. But he's still the big boss, so having him unhappy is BAD. 



I feel terrible. I'm also afraid of getting a reprimand because I unknowingly lobbied for the ""wrong"" person. For now, everyone is talking normally to me. I'm unsure if the CEO knows how much I was involved in the decision of getting Shaggy back to the office. 

I have no one to talk about it because I got the info via ""office gossip"". If my teammates get the info, they'll be crushed, especially Shaggy.. We all were so happy to have him back. But now it's also possible that he'll quit if he finds out the real reason his contract wasn't renewed. I wouldn't blame him. Why should he stay somewhere he isn't appreciated?

As far as I'm informed, we're now searching for a sixth team member, which would be great regarding the workload, but it's also making it extremely obvious that none of the existing members is going to get the 1-year contract in autumn. I'm afraid it's going to disturb the team dynamics and cause issues in the long run.

I learned my lesson, and I will never mingle into HR-business ever again...",TIFU by manipulating the new supervisor into hiring an old employee without knowing that the CEO didn't want this employee back in the office because of customer complaints.

"TIFU when i (19f) shared my phone screen w my bf (19m)
so for some context me and my bf are long distance. trust and communication is a big part of our relationships probably more than others bcs we wanna avoid misunderstandings and mistrust. we’ve both had past experiences w cheaters and have been very open w how much we struggled after experiencing that. kinda weird but ig we kinda trauma bonded after that and it was easier to trust one another too.

so to get to my point- today me and my bf were ft like normal and i was sharing my phone screen to show smth my friends had posted. i went to my search bar on my iphone to show smth else and tinder popped up when i started searching. my bf immediately saw it and was rightfully weirded out. he then started questioning me and i kinda buffered bcs i forgot i had the app and didn’t know how to explain the situation to him. 

basically why i have the app is bcs a couple weeks ago i was out drinking w some friends. a friend of mine is an avid user of tinder and she had a good thing going with a guy until he suddenly disappeared on her. my friend made all of us at the table download tinder, make anonymous accs and swipe until we saw him to check if he was newly active and if he ghosted her. 

i tried explaining to my bf the weird situation but he felt like i took too long to explain it and it was still weird. he kept telling me his “head was going crazy” and didn’t know if he could trust me for what he saw.  now we’re taking some space and i’m freaking out bcs i don’t want him to think i downloaded the app to cheat on him. ik i’ve hurt him but i don’t know how to reassure him without coming off as manipulative or as if im gaslighting him. atp im also freaking out bcs i love him sm and i js bought tickets to surprise him when i come over this summer. i don’t want to ruin something that the both of us have built and worked for:(",i made my bf think im cheating,i downloaded a tinder app w my bcs and now he thinks i downloaded it to cheat on him.
"TIFU by letting my daughter watch iPad on an 8 hour long car journey.
Two weeks ago, I went on an 8-hour car journey (for a holiday) and for the first 3 hours, so far so good. Then, my daughter says ""Dad, can I have my iPad?"" I say ""Aren't you queasy with it in the car?"" She then insists no, so I obliged. She was watching YouTube kids with her headphones in when she vomited (just after our food stop) down my back. The vomit ran down my shirt while the next service station is 50 miles away. When we arrived at the service station, I could not get it out. So we continued on. However, even with her iPad taken away, she vomited again down the open window and it all went in the crevice where the window goes when you put it down. When we arrived, the vomit had dried on my shirt, my back and the seat and the other vomit was still in the crevice. I had a shower and scrubbed the vomit off of the seats using a paper towel and water. I then took the car to a car wash who better cleaned the seats and the carpet. A bill of £130. They tried to clean the vomit from the crevice but failed. They said to go see a mechanic. Due to me being in a remote village in Scotland, there was no mechanic nearby so I had to make the 42 mile drive to one. They dismantled the door and cleaned the vomit from the crevice. I got a bill of £230. I got back to the hotel at around 9:30 pm. I had missed dinner. So I had to order room service for myself at 10:00 at night and quietly eat it to not wake up the others. I also f ed up by not having the vomit bags readily available.","My daughter asked for her iPad on a car journey, vomited down my back and the crevice where the window goes, the mechanic dismantles the door, mechanic and car wash charge me £360 in total.

"TIFU by wearing the clothes I left in the dryer for too long.
This didn't happen today, it happened yesterday and I'm still so fkn embarrassed abt it. My laundry dryer has this problem where the dryer door just opens for no reason when the clothes are still in it. The dryer can't run when open. I have been trying to dry these clothes for a week but the dryer won't fucking work. Yesterday I decided since I didn't have any actual clothes left I could just wear something from the dryer. It smelled a little bit, and was slightly damp, but I thought it wouldn't be that deep because it didn't smell that bad to me and no one would notice. Big mistake. I was in a rush so I put the clothes on and ran out the door. I was late to class. There was a movie playing and we were allowed to sit wherever we wanted so I sat in the same table as the people I actually liked. No one said anything about it, so I thought I was clear. I went to second period class and people were saying shit like ""why is it so musty in here?!"" I couldn't smell it but thought nothing of it. I then went to the cafeteria for the class field trip. My friend and I sat alone at one table and the first thing she said was ""why does it smell like shit around here?"" I was starting to catch on, but she was right next to me. I knew I was cooked but I decided to just not get within 5 feet of anyone else for the whole day. Well it didn't matter, because there were some teachers in the general area and I heard one of them say ""there's a smell over here, what is this?"" I knew I was cooked but I decided to just stay with the same group of people so they couldn't track it back to me. I got separated from these people as we were on different buses. I sat alone in the very back of the bus so as not to draw attention to myself.  My friend who was on the other side of the back of the bus was like ""EW WHY TF DOES IT STINK?!"" and a bunch of people in the general area were saying it smelled like shit. I decided to also act disgusted although I was nose blind. I hated myself at the moment but my objective was to not be found out. We all opened the bus windows and people were complaining. I was sweating hard, which probably made it worse. At this moment I wanted to just jump out of the bus and let it run me over. Eventually we got to the field trip which was this small ass escape room. I had to get in a group of 10 others. I had to use the bathroom, so I left to go to the bathroom and I came back. 4 seconds after I came back some guy screamed ""ok which one of y'all didn't wipe your ass?!"". I acted just as pissed off as everyone else, but then this person who I'm kinda friends with suddenly screamed ""it's u/thisuseristakenbreh!"" I asked why the fuck he thought that, and the person I sat next to in first period said ""well in first period you sat next to me in class and then it smelled like shit"". The guy that screamed started crashing out at me. I should have just stayed in the bathroom. This kept going on for a whole hour, with the mf constantly crashing out and giving me dirty looks. Once we got out, he told literally everyone. Every single person was giving me dirty looks except for one friend. As soon as I got back to school I sprayed an insane amount of perfume and went back to class. I don't know how I'll recover from this. I don't wanna be known as the stanky bitch for the rest of the year. I'm currently rewashing all my clothes with an insane amount of scent boosters and dryer sheets. I don't think I'll ever leave the house without 10 sprayed of perfume ever again.",I wore the slightly wet clothes out of the dryer and accidentally smelled like shit on the school trip,"Wore clothes I left in the dryer for too long, got caught by people who said it smelled like shit."

"TIFU accidentally triggering the fire alarm at the mall
So I was sitting at the bar at the mall earlier today, minding my own business and sipping on some refreshing cider, when I noticed a nondescript, unlabelled keypad on the wall next to me. I absent-mindedly started hitting the numbers on it, not really thinking of what it could be for, then pressed Cancel to ostensibly make sure nothing happened. Exactly five seconds later, the loudest fire alarm I've ever heard starts blaring, everyone is disconcerted and I try to act innocent and unassuming, fifteen seconds pass and one of the waitresses walks to the pad, punches some combination in, and thankfully everything goes back to normal, she then asks if I pressed anything, I tell her I did not, but she does not look fully convinced, either way she mercifully chooses to drop the issue and get back to work.

"TIFU by overdosing on herbal tea 🍵🍵
When I was pregnant, I avoided herbal teas containing liquorice root because it’s advised against in my country (UK) and mentioned on the NHS website. I had no underlying conditions, just following the guidance.

After giving birth, my husband gifted me a variety of herbal teas, and I started drinking them regularly, about 3 to 4 cups a day. The teas were like lemon and ginger nothing that was liquorice flavour but they happened to contain liquorice root.

Around six weeks postpartum, I started noticing that my body felt swollen and itchy, but I assumed it was just my hormones still adjusting after pregnancy. At my checkup, my midwife asked if I’d been feeling stressed. I mean, I had a newborn and a toddler, so I was definitely tired, but I didn’t feel particularly unwell. She checked my blood pressure, and it was dangerously high—around 180+/120+ mmHg. Alarmed, she referred me to a doctor immediately.

The doctor ran tests, including an ECG, and was preparing to put me on medication. He was baffled by how my blood pressure had spiked so suddenly. As I was about to leave, he paused and asked, “Wait, do you eat liquorice?”

I told him no, but I had been drinking herbal teas that contained liquorice root. His face lit up with relief, and he told me to stop drinking the tea immediately and try to relax as much as possible.

Easier said than done with a screaming newborn and a toddler. Shortly after, I felt my heart tighten, and I ended up in the hospital, where they had to monitor me and put me on blood pressure medication right away. I had to stay on it for six weeks before my blood pressure returned to normal.

Turns out, I had liquorice poisoning. This is a real and dangerous thing! Liquorice root can cause a dangerous rise in blood pressure, even in healthy people, if consumed in excess. Didn’t think 3/4 cups of tea was excessive 😢

So if you drink herbal tea, beware! It was a popular tea brand but don’t know if I can out them out.","I drank 3-4 cups of herbal tea daily after giving birth, not realising it contained liquorice root.

"TIFU by making Reddit posts a few weeks ago about wanting someone back who rejected me…
We did hook up a few months ago but then he rejected me for a legit reason and while I accepted that rejection I was desperate to be in a relationship with him so I got into the whole “manifesting a specific person” thing and ended up constantly writing about him on a subreddit about manifesting a specific person - not using our names but saying enough details for him and anyone else who knew our situation to have figured out it’s me talking about him. 

Before I knew he’s seen my posts about them, he “randomly” hid from me in person even though I didn’t do anything towards them, nicely messaged me to leave him alone whenever we see each other in person, and blocked me from his and his band’s Instagram accounts last night! After I then called him a POS (for blocking me) on their band’s discord forum (where I was also already “randomly” blocked before that but made a new account) and honestly said that I had felt pressured into hooking up with him the first night we met, one of bandmates told me it’s because someone somehow found my Reddit posts and knew it was me and showed him!

I deleted those posts so no need to go looking. And this became way more dramatic than it sounds, including me bawling my eyes out last night at 1am at a bar with strangers comforting me when I realized they blocked me, and having no idea it was because of my Reddit posts, then going on to bawl my eyes out more so at home. But when I found out he had seen my Reddit posts about him, I went from being extremely heartbroken to also extremely embarrassed.

"TIFU by signing work documents with penises NSFW
This happened over the course of mid 2023 to 2024, and I was officially caught right after my 20th birthday.

There I was, working a car manufacturing job for a fairly popular brand. The job itself wasn’t too bad, as I was lucky enough to end up in an easier section of the assembly line putting together the car bumpers, but the second shift hours (5:00 pm - 1:30 am) were absolutely NIGHTMARISH for a guy that had at least a few friends he liked to hang out with during the waking hours of the day. Pair that with the almost an hour drive there and hour back, and the immaturity of a 19 year old ridden with unmedicated ADHD and very poor forethought, and you get a guy that makes decisions as stupid as this.


The each section of the assembly line is split up into a bunch of somewhat simple and mundane jobs that we do on repeat as the cars come by, and we would remain on those for about 2 hours before each break period and rotate onto another so that we aren’t stuck doing the exact same thing for 8 hours straight. When it came to someone learning a job they’re new to, in order to keep from “drowning” as they called it, we would first be assigned to watch someone experienced on the job perform it, then try it ourselves over the course a few days. Once we’ve reached a point that we think we can complete the jobs without being supervised by someone experienced, we would “sign off” on them by signing an electronic document on an iPad after reading through the task instructions one last time. Well, the area to sign is a box that you use the touch screen to right on, and it was extremely common to just scribble random gibberish on it rather than place an actual signature.

Well, after quite a while of learning tasks and signing off on them, one day I just- decided to draw a wiener in the sign area. And I’m not talking in explicit detail, I’m talking the most basic, middle schooler penis drawings you can get. Two spheres and an oval in between them. I always figured that no one actually took the time to LOOK at the signatures, and that whenever you signed off on a job, a little checkmark would just appear next to your name on a data screen somewhere in upper management. My COWORKERS had seen me do this, and the more jaded ones would have themselves a little chuckle about it, but that would be it. No one snitched on me, that much I’m confident about. This went on for MONTHS, and nothing came out of it. I did it so much that it wasn’t even really that funny anymore, it just became a habit that I’d maybe have a giggle at once every few times I did it.


Fast forward after Christmas and into the new year of 2024, and the he schedule paired with the drive had become too much for me, and I finally threw in the towel and put in my two weeks notice in February and my last day was for March 1st. 

Another thing to note, is the reprimand system. Whenever you got in trouble for something, be it drowning the line too hard, getting caught with food or drinks other than water on the line, stuff like that, you’d get a “coaching”, which if you get too many of, becomes a “counseling” that sticks to your record for a few months and stops you from moving to different areas or getting promotions, so on and so on. With counselings, they pull you off the line to give you a slip of paper that explains these effects in detail, sort of just the typical corporate jargon. I had gotten one over a few attendance infractions (one of which was not being able to show up for a Saturday they were making us work due to production issues, which count against you on attendance even though we only get notified maybe 4 days before most of the time; another one of the reasons I quit) 

I’m sure you could only imagine my surprise when within the same week of my last day I was pulled off of the line and shown a counseling slip along with a lineup of my crudely drawn penises in faded ink printed on a blank sheet of paper by a a woman (who my coworkers would later go to speculate was the head of the entire factory building) that looked like she was just a few pushes away from addressing me with words that most certainly belong in the workplace even less than my penises did. She went on to lecture me about how immature and inappropriate it was (and yeah, she’s not wrong), and how much it pissed her off when she saw it. From the way she spoke, I don’t think she even knew that I was quitting that same week, and that she would literally never seen me again. After she was done, I silently signed the slip and went right back to my area, completely bewildered. Which honestly was a good thing because if I wasn’t, I doubt there’s a snowball’s chance in hell that I would’ve been able to keep a straight face. 

My coworkers, of course, thought it was absolutely hilarious. even our area manager, who had sent me over to receive the counseling but not known what it was about couldn’t hide that he thought it was funny when he found out. And he even went on to tell me, that I was right! No one actually looks at sign off signatures under normal circumstances. The only reason I was actually caught is because one of the new hires in the area I worked had some kind of error going on in the sign off system that required someone to comb through it, where my penises were discovered in all their glory. 

We all had a good laugh about it, (and so did my mother, despite being sure to instill a message that I should never do this again, which I won’t) and on my last day, I brought in a bag of the Albanese gummy bears I’m always eating to share with them as a parting gift, and some of my other coworkers brought in other stuff for everyone for the occasion too, and one even brought in a home cooked empanadas which I wasn’t expecting at all. After we had our fill of the bears, we drew more penises on the bears shown on the bag and everyone left a little signature wishing me well. No problem.

I still have the bag pinned to the wall of my bedroom. 

Although I did take a financial hit since that job, despite its faults, did pay really well, I can’t say I miss it all that much. But I do miss the people there. I’m a bit of an introvert so I don’t really know how to keep in contact with people unless I know them really well, i’ll never forget the things like all the bizarre conversations we used to have while we were so bored doing those repetitive jobs constantly.


Miss you guys, Bumper Lines A and B.

"TIFU by air frying a rat

Didn’t happen today (I’ve been reeling from the trauma for a while), but I remember it like it was yesterday.


My husband and I were both sick — like, *sick* sick, not eating a proper meal for days sick. Eventually, we both hit that point of recovery where we were actually hungry again, so I decided to do some easy cooking in the air fryer.


I put in a ready made chicken curry, on the bottom shelf, for lunch and left it for twenty minutes as directed. When I returned, there was an awful smell in kitchen. I’m trying to work out how to describe that smell — something like burnt rubber or plastic, perhaps? Like there was something very off. But when I checked my curry on the bottom shelf, it seemed fine.


So I ate that curry. That’s something I can never undo.


At dinner time, we decided to do a full easy roast, with sausages, Yorkshire puddings, potatoes, all that. Anyway, I had everything in the oven when I realised I had forgotten the stuffing balls I’d bought a few days before. They wouldn’t be done in time if I used the oven, but the air fryer would exp",,I ate a rat.
"TIFU trying to match someone on Feeld
Actually happened in the last hour or so. I try to match with someone on the dating app Feeld. They had a telegram because that app doesn't let you send messages for free. Talk to them on there. They start getting freaky with sending nudes and stuff. I was like damn?!?! I guess I should match your freak, even though I barely send dick pictures to my own wife(we are polyamorous). Because I didn't want to be an asshole. So I sent a flaccid and quart chub shot because they asked. Next thing you know it was a scam person. ""Send me $500 or I send these pictures to everyone you know and love"". Dude, my profile says I'm polyam, I don't give a shit if you send it to my wife or other people. They called, it was a dude instead of the woman I thought i talking to. So I warned everyone from my IG and FB profile, since that is where they were looking. Didn't send money, I don't really hide who I am. I apologized to everyone if they do get one. But it's nice to know everyone finds it funny and are glad they got the warning.","Try to match with someone on Feeld, they sent nudes I try to match them with dick pics.

"TIFU by buying enough cat litter for a continent of clowders
So technically this may be a YIFU (yesterday I fucked up) but I didn't realize the error in my ways until today. Also sorry for the bullet point formatting. I'm on mobile and - as you'll soon see - the only shit I have together is contained in a Litter Genie. 


* For some backstory: I'm disabled and my husband recently deployed - leaving me to single parent our four cats and all the food that goes in and shit that comes out of them. This is what brought us to this fuck up. I've been transferring some home essentials to automatic delivery so I don't hurt myself carting kilos of cat litter, cans, toilet paper, etc into the house and end up on the menu when I meet my demise to common household tasks and become a sacrificial buffet in the middle of the living room. Yes Amazon is the big bad but I need stuff brought to my door and I've had one too many male e-shoppers who need their hand held over how ground chuck isn't a replacement for chicken wings and I can't replace maxi pads by shoving makeup rounds up my vagooter to care at the moment. 


* So, I search Amazon for the cat litter my precious pride have decided is best for their zen garden shit house. I see what's available for subscribe and save and click the box for ""Add subscription, but need it now"". It's only 5% off vs the 15% but whatever. Shit will always happen and I need my litter now. I add another thing or two to my cart and go to check out but, huh, no litter in the cart. Search again and I see the same litter. Oh this is a bigger box. RIP the spine of my Amazon delivery person but this price is actually better, too. Repeat the process. Mind wanders and I see a toy they'll forget in a few days I'm sure but I'm a GOOD CAT MOM™️ and my babies will have an army of things they couldn't care less about. Check out time. Still no litter in cart. Back to square one of the search. Oh, what's different between the Purple and the Red lettering one? Maybe I'll try the red and see if it's different. Lower tracking, maybe? 


* Now I want to tell you that at some point my inner millennial Swiftie said ""It's me. I. I'm the problem it's me"". Trust me I do. However I officially invoke the Swiss cheese brain defense of multiple sclerosis having eaten all my sense and logic to shift sole blame to poorly programmed technology. I tried this a whole FOUR TIMES before going ""OK. I'll add it manually and will miss that 5% discount but whatever"". 


* Yesterday I got my delivery of litter. Only as I was pouring it did I go ""Huh. This is the purple lettering. I thought I was trying the red."". Probably a mistake on my part. Then getting up this morning I saw I had an alert from Amazon that my package is out for delivery. That's weird. I got my litter yesterday. The sacrifice to the shit gods had been made, right? Woa buddy was I wrong.


* Turns out each of those ""I need it now"" clicks were the same as ""Buy now"" in the sense that it bypassed the cart and processed it immediately. Four of my FIVE boxes of doodoo dipper dust have arrived. It's a good thing I have a side door because my understandably annoyed Amazon jockey piled three of the 27 lb boxes directly outside my front door - almost entombing me in my online shopping shame. I can only assume he's deduced that I have murdered someone and the litter is to soak the bodily fluids and dispose of the evidence so he's shutting me in to go down with the ship in the most tidy (cats) murder suicide of all time. This has definitely besmirched my good name as the person who puts out snacks and drinks for delivery people on hot days. I'll now be known as the brick shit house lady with a trigger finger for crap clay. 


* Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some shit to shovel and subscriptions to squelch.


*","I accidentally bought five separate orders of cat litter because I didn't know how Amazon's ordering works. The Amazon person probably thinks I'm crazy, a hoarder, and/or a murderer. At this point I'm hoping they didn't injure themselves lugging over 100 lbs of litter to my door.",I bought enough cat litter for a continent of clowders.
TIFU by trying to install a third party radio for my car,"bought after market car radio, tried installing. DOA aftermarket plus OEM radio no longer works now.

So a month ago I bought one of these expensive tablet style third party radios for my car. I was super excited for it since I have an older Ford Fusion with the 4” screen.

A month pass by and the screen finally arrives. I get all excited and start to attempt installation. I get pretty far into it but the tablet itself never powers on. I try everything to see if I’m connecting something incorrectly or something isn’t seated right, nothing, it just won’t turn on.

I needed to get someplace so I reinstall the old radio and now the actual radio doesn’t turn on anymore… i get AC, and my back up camera works fine, everything in the car works except the radio, it just looks like it’s about to turn on then goes back to the screen only displaying time and temperature…

I try every suggestion i can find, turning off the car and leaving it for hours, resetting the radio, unplugging the radio cables and replugging them back in, nothing.

I’m on the phone with tech support for the screen now to show them that it’s DOA.

So not only do I have a dead paper weight that cost me more money than any tablet has the right to demand, my car radio also got fucked…",I'm a dumbass.
"TIFU by not drinking enough water to wash down my pills
TIFU as it iterally just happened. 

As every evening I took my pills. Allergy meds and bunch of supplements. There's melatonin, K2, D3 and magnesium. My dose of magnesium comes in 3 thin see through capsules and it's a very fine powder. 

I always take it in 2 goes, the hard pills first, then the capsules. I drank maybe half of small glass altogether to get the pills down...

About 10 minutes later I burped. Home alone so the burp was... Quite vibrant. And there appeared a white cloud coming out of my mouth on the exhale of the burp. Instantly my throat and nose started burning. Took me a minute to realise I just burped a cloud of magnesium powder. Swear to god I've never seen anything like it!","didn't drink enough water and burped a cloud of magnesium powder.

"TIFU by giving my husband a playful pat
So this morning while I was at work my husband texted me and told me he'd have a surprise for me when I got home. Obviously I tried bugging him about it a bit over text but he wasn't budging on telling me, so I just told him that I was excited to see what the surprise was.

When I came home my husband wasn't at our apartment yet, so I just sat on the couch and waited for him to come home. He came home with Thai food shortly after, which I thought was the surprise. He said that wasn't it, then came up to me, gave me a kiss, and asked what I wanted to drink before he showed me the surprise.

I told him what I wanted, then gave him a pretty crisp smack on the hip/right by the groin. We smack each other like that (he usually goes for the ass, I go for his hip and his ass) all the time. We aren't exactly gentle with it but we're not going hard either, we basically do it firm enough to make the sound loud. I should also mention that my husband is pretty thin.

Instead of reacting the way he normally does, he jolted, bent over, and said ""Fuck!"" really loudly like I'd hurt him. Obviously I immediately started apologizing and asking him if he was okay. He took a second, told me it was fine, then pulled his pants down and showed me the surprise: a brand new tattoo over his hip/groin/lower stomach, right where I smacked him.","I gave my husband a crisp smack to be affectionate, but in doing so hit him right where he'd just gotten a brand new tattoo that I didn't know about until after.",I smacked my husband on the hip/right by the groin and he thought I was going to hurt him.
"TIFU by jokingly not accepting my friend's apology, not they are really mad.
My friend and I know each other for a while, we live far away apart so messages and phone calls is only way we hang out, but for the past few weeks they don't respond much I know life can be messy and thanks to different time zones I could be calling at very inconvenient time without a clue, so I don't call often just leave a massage on their Instagram.

Lately they only respond with memes and links to YouTube and reels, don't respond directly to my messages, felt like they are on autopilot, I had a rough few days and really wanted to talk to them about it but all what I got was an irrelevant meme, that upset me a little and left a serious massage asking what's going on and why you behave this way.

And 2 days later they responded with a real response, turned out they just didn't check the inbox and send me links to stuff I might be interested in, they weren't really busy with anything just not checking their socials and truelly apologized to me for not being there when I needed them.

I had this stupid idea of demonstrate I am not mad or upset by joking with them, so I said "" apology not accepted you have to bow down and do more"" I immediately followed with kidding I am kidding I am not upset but it was too late, they were MAD said they made a true genuine apology and I spat on their face, and went on on how I am always like this, I don't take serious sensitive moments seriously and say disrespectful things for stupid gigs and Lolz.",: I jokingly and disrespectfully didn't accept my friend's apology it upset them and unleashed a flood gate of bottled emotions and anger towards stupid things I have done in the past.,"TIFU by jokingly not accepting friend's apology, not they are really mad."
"TIFU by running a bath
So I decided to treat myself to a nice, relaxing bath after a long day at work. I turned on the water and since I knew it would take a while to fill (the water pressure is absolutely awful) I went to grab a cold drink, my book and also put a load of laundry on. I then also got distracted by a text that I won't even bother getting into....the bath was pretty much an afterthought at this point.

Then what do you know?? the fire alarm starts blaring through the building! 🙃🙃 I freaked out and well...ran to evacuate as one does. Shoes, jacket, run! is all I thought. Silly is an understatement. 

It honestly did not hit me for about 40 mins (which is crazy) but once it did...oh my FREAKING GOD! My heart dropped and I started panicking, but we weren't cleared to go back in the building yet. I was damn near crying thinking ""F***! I am so freaking stupid!!!"" Fast forward and we finally get the all-clear. I ran back so fast people probably thought ""what on earth?"". I get inside, run to the bathroom and yes...of course the entire ocean is there with me, pouring and pouring out (luckily I don't have carpet but that doesn't even matter with how bad this was) What a freaking mess and it was SCOLDING HOT! I'm burning myself trying to turn the faucet off and run to grab my mop to try pop the plug out...which did not go well at all. I broke down completely and gave up for about an hour (also to let the water cool down).

"TIFU by thinking a security guard was a panhandler
I visit a lot of different places and do a lot of work in my car and one of the most annoying things is how often beggars see someone sitting in their car as a potential target for their begging. 

When I started I was constantly being interrupted by someone knocking on my window to ask for money, a ride, or whether else they need at the moment. I eventually learned to watch for them and now when I see someone walking my way I just drive off and find somewhere new to park. If it’s somewhere I need to stay I just drive away then come back when they’re gone. 

Today I was getting ready to go visit one of my clients when I saw a guy going from car to car and knocking on windows. When he headed my way I drove off and came back a few minutes later but he was still there. He saw me and approached again so I drove off again. 

After doing this one more time I decided to just suck it up and deal with it. I parked in a spot and waited for him to approach, ready to say no to whatever he wanted. As expected he came up and when I asked what he wanted it turned out he was security and was making sure no employees parked in visitor parking. I told him I was a visitor and he asked why I kept dodging him. 

Luckily he thought it was funny when I explained but I was pretty embarrassed

"TIFU running while sick
I do a bit of running.  To stay in shape and feel good.  I'm not a competitive runner but I enter events so I have goals to work toward.  I have a 10km event coming up in a few weeks.

I got sick last week and was mostly better but still had a congested chest by Tuesday.  I had a 10km run scheduled and I couldn't really afford to miss it.

I drove to my favourite riverside running track.  Around 4km into the run, still outbound (uphill), I startex to feel tired.  HR wX higher than usual at this point.   Only 1km to go before turnaround and the leg is down hill.   So I eat some honey and push on.

At the 7km point people started looking like they're concerned for me.  Around 8.5km, a guy asked if I'm OK. But I felt good,  just a little slow.  So I upped the pace and got back to the car.  Tired but pleased with myself, even a little smug,  for persisting.

Here comes the fuck up.  About two minutes into the drive home I started seeing lots of little spots and feeling dizzy.  I pulled over, sipped sprite until I felt better and carried on.  

When I got home I still felt odd. So, I grabbed an O2 sensor.  It was 91. Whoops.  

I'm a diver and I have a medical oxygen bottle for use on the boat, so I grabbed that.  My 02 bounces back after 10 minutes or so.

"TI Fucked UP by believing a work prank on April 1st and embarrassing myself in front of everyone.
At work, my boss sent out an all-staff email saying that the company was implementing a “4-day workweek experiment” starting next month. We would all get Fridays off with full pay as long as productivity remained high. I nearly lost my mind with excitement. I even replied, “This is amazing! Best boss ever!” before reading the rest of the email, where he mentioned how this was part of a ‘global initiative’ called ‘April Fool’s for Better Work-Life Balance.’

Realizing my mistake, I tried to unsend the email… but it was too late. People were already reacting with laughing emojis in the company group chat. To make it worse, my boss personally replied, “Glad to see you’re passionate about work-life balance! Unfortunately, your excitement is also part of the experiment how easily employees fall for corporate jokes.”

But that’s not even the worst part.

"TIFU by forgetting about metals
I never knew I was allergic to nickel, I didn't even know an allergy to nickel was a thing.  My lovely bride bought me a tungsten wedding band to replace the original gold one that had worn precariously thin.  After a few days, the skin under the ring started to feel like I was getting a chemical burn and so I stopped wearing the tungsten ring for a few days.  Things improved so I went back to wearing the tungsten ring and even ignored the discomfort; until the rash spread out beyond the area covered by the ring and upon removing the ring it was obvious something was wrong.  The skin under the ring was itchy, irritated, and red like a chemical burn (let some PVC glue dry on your skin if you need to know what it feels like).  That was a couple of years ago.

Now, onto where I fucked up.  I needed to remove about 1/4"" of material from a stainless steel fitting to get it mounted in the correct orientation.  If you don't know, stainless is a bear to cut, if you aren't careful you'll just destroy the tool you are trying to cut with.  So with that in mind, I decided to sand off the bit I needed to remove.  After I finished, my hands were on fire.  It felt like I had dipped them in acid or a pile of glass shards.

He then said the classic ""well, I won't say anything ever again"" (just like all dads do) and I said ""yes please."" I know that was petty but giving that I was so close to exploding this response was pretty okay to me. And then he started yelling at me, stood up from the table, told me the typical ""I've always been there for you for your whole life"" (idk what that had to do with anything, he just wanted to make me feel guilty, not new at all.) And then he went upstairs. My mom and brother were silent. Now he has taken his bike which means he is going to his favorite bar and drink and I just hope he doesn't get too drunk.

"TI FU by accidentally violating an NDA during a consultation and now my company might get sued
Not today, but last week, I (M26) was in a consultation with our parent company. Nothing out of the ordinary—we’ve had these kinds of meetings before. But then I opened my mouth and made the mistake. I referenced information that was covered under an NDA. I didn’t even think about it in the moment. It just slipped out but the moment the words left my mouth, I could feel the shift in the room. 

Monday is when I realized how screwed I am. Came to work to find my inbox was blowing up. The legal team has been looped in. My managers have been pulled me into an emergency meeting. I was sure I going to get the boot but it’s worse. Our parent company might sue us for unfair commercial practices and conflict of interest. If that happens I’m beyond cooked.

I’m still employed… for now. But the worst part is, I don’t know what’s going to happen. There are financial penalties in the NDA. Regardless of what happens I’ll be on the hook for damages. I’m not worried about becoming bankrupt. It’s the career limiting blunder that I can’t shake.

I’ve made mistakes before, sure, but this is next level. I feel like I just hit the eject button on everything I’ve worked for. I have a meeting coming up with our legal team, and I’m dreading it.

I had a large piece of leftover brie that I wanted to warm up slightly, to bring it to room temperature as the cheese was basically freezing cold from being in the fridge for a good few days. 

I was basically hankering for this cheese at room temperature and didn't want to wait, so I made the ""smart-arse"" move of bunging it in the microwave on a toast sized plate.

I partially unwrapped the cheese but was stupid enough to leave the open wrapper between the plate and the cheese. I thought the wrapper was going to be okay to go in as it was mostly paper. but what I forgot was that one side of the wrapper was metallic as it was president brie, even though the metallic side was face down and flat on the plate. 

I slowly warmed it up in ten seconds bursts, until about a minute in where the microwave started making dangerous noises and lightning flashes and was close to blowing up, so I immediately pressed stop, switched it off from the wall then unplugged it as a good last measure.

For context, I'm pretty okay-ish with my identity. Sort of. I know that I don't particularly care for intimacy and I'm on-and-off with romance and general love. I don't mind being whatever gender or using whatever pronouns because in the end, to me, they’re just words. I'm also a pretty flirtatious person, in the sense that I'm comfortable fake flirting with people if they were to start it or hint at it. I know who to do it with and  when to stop, of course. I think that's all you need to know about me.

My friend Kim has been my friend for four years now. She's quiet in the sense that she only talks to people she knows well and she has a lovely way of telling jokes that always make me laugh hardest. Kim loves astrology, but also loves learning about the world and its geography, whereas I'm a bit more literary with writing and arts. She approached me one day with a stereotypical question about hating the class we had (something she stills flushes about today), and we've been shoulder to shoulder ever since. 

At first I didn't really think of her as anything more than a friend, because she had other friends she had known for longer, so I always thought of myself as a friend she had during lectures, unlike her friend Jane which she had known for over a decade. I'm also pretty close with Jane; I helped her navigate one of her crushes and what to do in order to confess to her, which worked out well.

But over time Kim and I grew closer and closer to the point that I don't think of any friend but her. Whenever I'm out and about and I see something, it reminds me of her, and she's always my first thought. I always thought it was just friends being friends and dismissed it. We would flirt over text with jokes about kissing and sending each other things about couples and titling it ""literally us"". She once told me she wasn't sure if I even was gay or if my straight-personality was too good, which I thought was funny. I THINK she's gay as well, I'm never sure, but she doesn’t like men at all. I think. 

Anyways, onto the actual title. 

Today we were talking outside our lecture hall and making jokes about hiding in the classroom in the dark and ""oh nooo the door is locked whatever will we do to pass the time??"" When she told me that she doesn't even know if us flirting is a joke or not. I told her that we make these jokes so frequently I wasn’t sure either. She said that if we both weren't sure, we could make an ""maybe relationship"". I was like what lol?? And she told me that we could say we're girlfriends, but not actually commit to it. If it feels right, we'll be a thing, and if it doesn't, we both forget it ever happened and move on. 

So I was like yeah sure whatever cus you know what do I have to lose, but I was on the bus and thinking about it, and dude. I kept on thinking about getting her flowers and getting on my knee with a little fake ring pop for her and I couldn't stop blushing to myself. But she's obviously joking about the whole thing and I'm the only one overreacting here. I don’t want to be a creep by actually advancing on her when we were supposed to be joking. But I can't stop thinking about the whole thing and her. It's torture. I feel like I want to cry everytime I think of us as something more but I don't know why. I've never had a crush. I've never been in love. I always mistake friend love for romance love. Is this actual love???

"TIFU by trying to make a friend get closer to their parents
Before I start it all, I'll give some context:

I've known this friend for about 2.5 years and always get discover something new about them every day, and yesterday I heard from a friend that their relationship with their parents (specially their father) isn't one of the best, and it was not their fault.

Today when I got home I started to talk with this friend and they where sending me some videos that started to show up for them, most of the videos were about sad stories like a old couple saying goodbye, a pregnant woman telling her father about her needing to ""take care of her baby and her ill father"" and etc. 
     I obviously got sad when reacting to those videos but one particularly hit me hard, it was a video where the guy said how he wouldn't have the opportunity to eat his mom's meals anymore, and preparing the last portion his mother gave him before she died. 
     I've already seen that video before but for some reason, it hit me different, I said I would go to my mother and talk to her, and after I did so, I got back asking my friend so they do the same, thinking ""They might not have the best of the relationships with their parents, but at least they should show love for them"". They replied that their mother was working and when I talked about their father, they mentioned how he normally declines things like hugs and stuff.
     I was going to start saying ""Oh, if he doesn't accept, ask for it"" when they said ""That's enough of that Topic"", and that's when it hit me. Throughout the conversation I didn't noticed I was ignoring what they would like, what they cared to do and even if they cared about it, when I read it I just crashed out and felt I needed to apologize, they said it was fine and they just didn't like to talk about it, but as of things that already happened, they say that almost everytime someone apologize.
     After that I tried to send other kinds of videos to try and ""break the ice"", but they already went to sleep or something and I just felt like shit and that I needed to apologize even more, but also knew that they didn't like apologies, so I went sometime without saying nothing, and just wrote some stuff trying to redeem myself and sort of explain as well.
     I'm thinking about deleting those final messages since they probably still didn't see it, but also feel like there are things there I've been wanting to say before, and that even if I leave it there, it's just gonna be ignored.

     Sorry if the English is bad, not my first language and I'm writing this tired as hell since that was NOT the only thing I fucked-up with today. Felt like telling someone this but don't have no one to talk about without getting ""solutions"" and stuff.",Insisted that my friend would get closer to her parents and probably triggered something I didn't need to talk about at the moment.,"I'm trying to make a friend get closer to their parents, but I'm not sure how to do it."
TIFU by accidentally spitting soda on my friend while laughing in a hang out.,"I suddenly laughed and accidentally spat soda on my friend while on a hang out.

Someone in my friend group brought April fools enchiladas flavored soda. I took the challenge to drink it and a small crowd formed around me. Everyone was laughing at how ""crazy"" I was to take on the challenge. Maybe its contagious laughter; maybe its because someone said ""yo that's freaky.""

I laughed in the middle and accidentally spat a mouthful onto my friend in front of the crowd. I felt so embarrassed, apologized multiple times, grabbed paper towels, offered to buy a new shirt.

I was forgiven. She politely declined the new shirt. We all laughed it off. But that embarrassment and ""I owe you one,"" is gonna stay. Maybe it'll just be a funny story looking back years from now, but I can't imagine the gross feeling being on the receiving end. 😭😭😭",I'm a dumbass.
"TIFU by streaking (naked) in front of a subordinate
Obligatory disclaimer that these events happened 20 and 15 years ago, but it just resurfaced when I spoke to my streaker friend the other week... and the earlier post about streaking sealed the deal.

There I was playing naked rugby on a side street, somewhere in Clapham Jnc, London, with a mate of mine. It was just something we did and, back then, it didn't seem to upset anyone. Anyway, there was a house party over the road which had spilled out into the front garden as it was a nice summer evening (warm enough to be naked if you know what I mean).

We had a few cheers, whistles, and claps, so we continued to kick and pass the rugby ball to each other. Then a police van went past on the main road, slowed down, reversed, and pulled into our road. We quickly ran back to the front door of my mate's apartment building, but not having pockets, we didn't have a key. We pressed the buzzer, but the flatmates didn't buzz us in as we had been trying their patience all day (sorry girls).

A female and a male officer approached us. I was using the ball to maintain my modesty while pressing the buzzer with my free hand, and my mate was using both his hands to cover himself. The female officer was not amused, but the male officer could barely contain his giggles. She yelled that if we weren’t inside in 5 seconds we'd be arrested. Just before she counted to 5, and after some frantic buzzer pressing, the door was buzzed open and we fell in, to loud approval from the party. End of story? Nope.

5 years later we were sitting around in the office having some late Friday afternoon beers and someone suggested we recount stories about close brushes with the law. People were talking about being let off speeding tickets, being chased in the park for underage drinking, nicking girlie mags from the corner shop, etc. I told the story above and got some laughs, but one girl on my team (who'd been at the company \~1 year) was just looking at me. She asked if it was 'so-and-so' road, and I confirmed the name of the building my mate lived in. It turns out that it was her party who witnessed our close call with the coppers. Everyone went silent as the penny dropped - that someone on my team had seen me naked. Then we all laughed harder. Thankfully she saw the funny side of it, but she was briefly a little red-faced.

Sorry for embarrassing you Nikki!

I'd like to say that was the end of my streaking career and the police, but a friend's wedding in the Cotswolds is another story...","Played naked rugby in the street in front of a party, almost got arrested. 5 years later, turns out it was a colleague's party.",Got caught playing naked rugby in front of a house party.
"TIFU by telling my partner telling my partner that I've been with guys before.
TIFU when I told my marriage partner that I've been with guys before. I kinda mentioned it once before  and at that time, surprisingly no questions came up.

Today I don't recall what kicked it off but we got back on the topic. 
Wait pre-story, 3 weeks ago we went to Vipassana and it was great for me. Time to process so much. At the end of Vipassana, I told my partner that, I feel ok about the time I was with guys (3 separate occasions), partly for the money and partly for the attention. 

Ok back to today, present, we start talking about it and we get into the details, not graphic but sufficient I think. 

Umm it was a lot of post communicating about who I
am today vs who I was in the past. Their response overall was that they should of questioned me more before we got married and they feel icky about it .

I work in video publishing, and today we were discussing a future social media post during a meeting that references two songs; Eternal Flame by the Bangles (1989), and Ring of Fire by Johnny Cash (1963).

I am the only Gen-Z employee at my place of work, and while I was familiar with both of these songs, l didn't really grow up with them. They were already on the oldies radio before I was born, and out of recent pop culture by the time I was old enough to get involved with it.

What I do know is that our audience demogra v spans from about 15-35 years old in age range, so when we discussed the songs, without thinking about it, I said ""Are we sure our audience will understand these old references?""

It did not occur to me that my coworkers, who range from mid-30s to late 50s would understand the references, so naturally what happened was them hearing me call them all old.

So we are in a long distance relationship for 4 or 5 months, we have quite a good bond, she is a very religious person, some weeks ago she asked me for some nsfw photos and asked me to send it if I'm okay with it, I did it and her response to it was quite good so I sent her more photos. 
The day before yesterday we were talking naughty and she knows I am very much attracted to her boobs and asked me if I want a pic of her bra, I was on the 7th cloud soo happy and all she sent me today and I was talking with my friend on call at that time, so couldn't see it properly but I downloaded it, I responded to it told her how good and beautiful it is and it really made me soo happy.
Then she deleted it, I asked her about why she did it, she said it's bcs its something is very sensitive to her, I told her I have downloaded it, she asked me to delete it saying you just had to see it one time and not download it or anything, I said I didn't know, and I was insisting on not deleting it telling her no I don't wanna, it had made me soo happy to finally got something like that from her, she started saying no i have to delete them.
After pleading to her she said okay have it for a day and then a week, and all this time I was on the call with my friend getting frustrated between talking and chatting and it was an important call so I couldn't hang up(I also let her know about it btw).
I and frustrated and all and started calling her how full of herself she is that she is asking me to delete it and she shouldn't do that bcs it will make me upset(ik it's fked up but I was not myself, soo frustrated, ik it's my mistake) and I started saying that when I send you those pics I didn't asked you to delete them, then why are you asking me and started saying she doesn't care about my feelings and we don't have equality in our relationship, at this point I hung up the call with my friend. 
After this she got upset and said she wasn't comfortable with it that's why I asked you to delete them, you just had to see them one time and she can't see how she is being full of herself here and also said when she asked for pics from me she first took consent if I'm okay with it.
After this she said she doesn't feel like talking with me and I am sure she got very upset bcs of it.

"TIFU by using a hair removal cream on my lady bits with no prior experience and right after sexy time
So I recently bought a hair removal cream that I assumed was 100% safe to use with no prior knowledge because the logo had aloe vera plants on it. I had some sexy time with my boyfriend and didn't clean up afterwards, then decided I might as well try it since I had some stubble down there and I love and crave the smooth shark feel on my skin. I put it on for the recommended 5 mins and saw I still had some hair left after wiping it off, so I decided to reapply a little on the areas I had applied it in before and a lot where I still had a lot, then left it another 5 mins. While I waited, I decided to read the back of the cream tub and saw it absolutely, definitely, never ever ever be on my skin more than 7 mins, and that I should not even be using it so close to my genitals AT ALL. That's when I knew I f'd up. I finally stopped dissociating, and felt a slight burning sensation on my taco, and ran to the shower. I washed everything off, and it stung like hell, but not where only the cream was, but where I had hot milky spilled in me and didn't clean up then put cream on top of. I guess the combination of the unnamed liquid and the hair removal cream turned out very lethal. Thankfully I took it off before it did some heavy damage, and the stinging sensation on my pupu went down, but now I know I should probably stick to waxing... I'm not very smart when it comes to anything chemical related.","I decided to use hair removal cream right after sexy time without cleaning up, and ended up with a burning taco down there.",TIFU by using hair removal cream on my lady bits with no prior experience and right after sexy time.

"TIFU by April Foolsing Myself
I completely April Fools’d myself via Snapchat. I (25 y/o female) barely use Snapchat anymore, but one thing I do use it for is to keep NSFW photos in the “My Eyes Only” section. Last night around 3am, I was cleaning out some of these photos and copied one to send to my boyfriend. It turns out that when I copied this one photo, I also posted it on my story. I proceeded to fall asleep shortly thereafter. I woke up a few hours later to texts from two of my COUSINS who were completely horrified and notifying me of my mistake (thank god), warning me that I should take it down immediately. I of course had no idea what they were talking about, but quickly went to my snapchat and discovered a topless photo of me was on my story and had been viewed by 22 people. I am completely mortified. Part of me is telling myself, “Oh well, at least it was one of the better photos, and I go to topless beaches all the time so who cares,” but overall I’m just fucking humiliated. The only other person who reached out to me about it is a gay guy from my high school choir who I haven’t spoken to in almost a decade, simply writing, “Hey, did you mean to post this?” It actually made me laugh.

I (28F) was in a big rush because I was late for a meeting. I quickly dressed up, used the bathroom and left for the office. I had to navigate the busy crowd in my apartment complex and rush of the College kids (a college campus is right next to us) but I made it onto the streets.

"TI Fucked up by pranking myself with a prank meant for my coworkers.

Obligatory: the FU was actually yesterday, but the consequences were felt today. 

A few years ago, I purchased a small device that makes different cat noises at random intervals. I intended to bring it into work and hide it in the main office as a prank on the administrators for April Fools’ day that year. Well, I forgot to bring it in that year along with the other half dozen or so pranks I had planned (fake positive pregnancy test for the staff bathroom, fake cockroaches for the kitchen, etc). I set it aside for future use and forgot about it. 

So, a few years have gone by and I randomly found the cat noise device in a drawer yesterday. I turned it on and it miraculously still worked! So I decided to set it out so I’d remember to take in today. Somehow I must’ve gotten distracted on my way to putting it by the front door because somehow it didn’t make it there, but I didn’t realize this until right around midnight. 

I was tossing and turning and suddenly heard a loud cat meow so I jumped out of bed to go see if I could get it to shut off before it woke up any of my family members. (No idea how I didn’t heard it any other time during the evening before then.) I searched by the front door and around all of the common spaces but couldn’t find it. It only goes off every 5-15 minutes so once you hear it, that’s it for a while. I finally decided to give up and get some sleep and resume the search when I woke up in the morning. 

I woke up extra early to have time to sneak it into the office before everyone else arrived, and a little extra early so I’d have time to find it in the light of day. Well, I was finally able to pinpoint the sound in our laundry room. Only issue is that there were 6 baskets of clean laundry to that it could’ve fallen into. (We have issues putting away clean clothes, please don’t judge. I’ve learned my lesson.) After going through each item of clothing in every single basket I still could not find the damn noise maker! I ended up recruiting another family member to help look and they couldn’t find it either. I decided to take the L and get ready for work, and even after another very thorough pass before headed out the door, I still can’t find it! I clearly heard it go off a few times during my search and it always sounded like it was coming from right next to me/inside one of the laundry baskets. 

I’m still miffed that another year has gone by and I still can’t play this prank on my coworkers! And I’m assuming the battery will finally be dead by this time next year. 

Also hoping it doesn’t drive me crazy with intermittent cat sounds until the battery finally craps out.",,"Tried to prank myself with a cat noise device, couldn’t find it."
"TIFU by Not Somehow Messing Up our Gender Reveal Recording
My wonderful wife and I are expecting our first child in September. We had a small zoom call with our families & friends and a cake. to share the moment. I'm somewhat tech savvy but always seem prone to stupid errors. So when I joined the meeting, I immediately tested by starting & stopping the recording a few times with just me&my in-laws to make sure it was working. Once everyone got on (about 20 people total), we cut into the cake, had some laughs, and then ended the recording and the meeting shortly after. We aren't the biggest fans of attention but honestly the little call was so perfect. We had a few friends in-person so we hung out for an hour and then they left. 

I got on the computer shortly after to look at our video , and to my horror found out that all the test videos recorded but the actual meeting did not. I have no idea why, as myself and my wife both heard zoom say ""Recording started"" when I hit the button. I know it should be an afterthought to a very joyful day, but this really has me upset.

"TIFU when I forgot to hide my parrot
Whenever my parents visit me, I always make sure to hide my parrot in my bedroom. I do that because my parrot never shuts up when I have guests. On top of that, it only says inappropriate things. Inappropriate things it's overheard. Rewind to earlier in the week. My mom and dad visited me. My parrot watched my parents from its cage, which was still in my living room, instead of my bedroom, aka the room I normally used to hide my dirty talking bird. I was unaware of my oversight until my dad approached the birdcage after greeting me and asked me if my parrot said anything. I said sometimes. My dad waved at my parrot and unsuccessfully attempted to have a conversation with it like he was Dr Dolittle. My parrot played dumb and stared at my dad in silence, which was the reaction I wanted, even though my dad seemed somewhat underwhelmed.

About an hour after all of us pretty much forgot about the bird in the background, my parrot unexpectedly shouted ""cum in my mouth!"" for no fucking reason. My mom, who was in the middle of telling me to stop with the tattoos, paused mid sentence because of my parrot. It repeatedly shouted ""cum in my mouth!"" enough times for me to finally get up and take it to my bedroom where it was out of sight and harder to hear. When I returned to the living room, my parents looked at me like they were expecting an explanation. I suddenly turned into an awkward teenage boy who didn't think before speaking and said the bird must have heard those words coming from the apartment next door. My mom lowered her voice all of a sudden and awkwardly asked if the people next door were having ""sexual intercourse."" 

Before I could respond, my dad said ""LOUD sexual intercourse if the bird could hear it."" My mom got up and said she was gonna go next door on my behalf and tell the people inside to keep it down because I did not consent to listen to them being intimate. I begged my mom not to be a Karen and pointed out that I didn't even know if my parrot heard the sound from the people next door. It could've been the people upstairs. Thin walls! My mom said my dad could speak to the people upstairs while she goes next door. My dad said he was willing to do that, if he could take the parrot with him. I said the parrot was not going anywhere because none of the people in the other apartments were responsible for what it was saying. I reluctantly explained to my parents that my parrot was saying what it heard my girlfriend say when she was having ""sexual intercourse"" with me. 

My mom, who was literally no longer blinking her eyes, asked me when was I gonna tell her that I was in a relationship, before or after ejaculating in my girlfriend's mouth. My dad raised his hand and said he was gonna go with ""after."" Words cannot express the level of cringe I was experiencing while hearing both my parents comment on my cum. When the two of them finally left, I thanked my parrot for the trauma.

"TIFU by unwittingly insulting a student's long-distance relationship
The title is a bit of a lie because this happened on Friday, not today, but that's close enough for me. My wife and I are both professors and on Fridays our department usually has a social hour in the late afternoon. We skip this event more often than we attend it, but there was good pizza this time, so my wife and I went. We ended up eating and chatting with a few other professors and graduate students (all of whom were either our students or students whose committees one or both of us are on).

We knew most of the people we were with quite well, except for one of the students. My wife and I are both on his committee, but neither one of us is his advisor. He's quite quiet and tends not to share much at these kinds of events or during classes or committee meetings, so I didn't know much about him on a personal level.

At some point, the newest professor (who just joined us in September) in the group started talking about how hard it was to be away from her wife for so long.

She was talking about how she and her wife take turns visiting each other at least once a month and was just generally venting about how difficult it was.

I told her that I was sorry that they were going through that and that I couldn't imagine being apart from my wife so much. I then said that I find couples who elect to live apart long term (as in over a year) and who aren't bothered much by that distance to be very weird and that I suspected that such couples don't really have a very strong relationship.

This clearly upset the student I don't know well very much. He essentially said that that was a judgmental thing to say, then stormed off. The oldest student in the group (one of my wife's students, and a student whose committee I serve on) then said that I had basically just described that student's relationship with his spouse, which left me feeling like a right asshole.",I said I thought long term long distance relationships that are happily long distance are probably not strong relationships overall to someone who's in exactly that kind of relationship.,I accidentally insulted a student's long-distance relationship.
"TIFU by spilling my friends secrets
I(16 F) have a best friend. We’ve been friends since beginning of middle school, therefore, she has also told me most of her secrets, and I have told her my secrets too. Over the past year, I found out she’s been telling all my secrets to this random guy she has a crush on and has barely known for a year, spilled my other friends secrets to him , and trash talked all of us, while trying to put the blame on my other friends. She’s also acted very rude and is quick to argue and try and make you feel dumb for no reason. Because of this, I got mad and decided I was going to forever cut her off, going based off my family’s advice, since she was being completely fake. During this time, I was also a little close with my dance team that I am in, and after the end of one of our practices we were all spilling tea, when I butted and started spilling all the tea about my best friend. I Told them everything including her being fake, trash talking me all the time, and choosing a random guy over her own friend, but i also said stuff that wasn’t even necessary, including her personal life style and the morally wrong things she’s done. I did this because I believed I was never going to talk to her ever again and that I was going to
cut her off, which I failed at doing, and telling myself this was Karma for what she did, basically being very immature and wrong. Month later, I realize that although she has done wrong stuff to me she is still my friend whether I like it or not , and I see her almost everyday, and now i regret telling anyone about her. I know I am clearly in the wrong, as even though she has done bad stuff to me I should have never done it back. Now, my new friends always bring it up and make jokes about her, which makes me feel even worse.What should I do? I plan on defending my friend or saying that everything I said about her was false and that someone had lied to me, so they no longer see her with a horrible reputation. I am also no long gonna tell them about any other issues with her. Is there anything else I can do?

"TIFU by driving through a tornado to see my girlfriend
Last night/this morning I was planning on going to my girlfriends house to get Chinese(which I really wanted), but right before I left there was tornado sirens, and a warning. After watching the news I thought it was just severe thunderstorms around me and not any tornados anywhere close. I went ahead and left my house to go to hers. It was raining very hard with a lot of thunder and dark skies. About 5 minutes into my drive I got one of those tornado warnings on my phone that read pull over now tornado warning. I disregarded it as I thought it was for all surrounding areas. Just a few minutes later I noticed wind picking up and starting to go crazy, stop lights were upside down from wind, sparks were flying from the hospital electrical transformer and debris was flying legit everywhere. I just kept going thinking it was normal thunderstorm stuff. It wasn’t until I got calls from my mom and close ones that I was legit under a tornado. Thats when wind picked up super bad and I felt my car kind of sliding but not much. My gf called and frantically called me telling me the tornado was practically on top of me. I just told her I loved her and hauled ass to my buddies house who was nearby. I made it there safely but not without a ton of trees falling and blocking the road.

"TI by accidentally traumatizing my mom with my Twitter likes
Yesterday I felt more embarrassed than I ever felt in years

some important context: my family is very repressed when it comes to sexuality. Like, we never talk about it. Ever. Nudity? Taboo. EG, We cannot visit art museums. I don’t get changed around my brother. That’s the level we’re operating on.

Anyway, a few days ago I was talking to my mom and she dropped the most horrifying remark. Out of nowhere she says something like, “Yeah, I stopped using Twitter a while ago. I saw some of the pictures you were liking and reposting.” I asked what she meant, trying to play dumb, and she said, “There were… women. Naked women.” That’s when I died 

Apparently, she had gone to my Twitter page at some point, probably out of mom-level stalking, which, for the record, included a few NSFW posts from some art accounts I follow. Not porn, but definitely full-on “naked woman everything out casually standing in soft lighting staring pensively at a window” kind of stuff. But honestly I just thought they were really beautiful and I didn’t feel embarrassed about liking and reposting them when I did! It’s just the moral/cultural collision that kills me. (And also ftr she still doesn’t know about the mixed gender bathouse or nude beach I visited in california and hopefully never will).

Now, this would be an embarrassing son-mom interaction in any family. But in my family? This is like… generational shame territory. We don’t acknowledge that we’re sexual beings. We don’t acknowledge that anyone is a sexual being. It’s just all unspoken. So now I know she knows. And she knows I know she knows. And she knows I know she knows I know about female nudity.

I haven’t felt this mortified since puberty. Every time I see her now, all I can think of is her seeing those posts and quietly deciding to log off Twitter forever and maybe my life also. Like, I literally ran her off the platform with my thirst.

I will never recover. Ever.","My mom saw I liked pictures of naked women on Twitter, said that’s why she quit the app, and now I live in a perpetual state of embarrassment because we’ve never, ever discussed anything remotely sexual in our lives.",I accidentally traumatized my mom with my Twitter likes.
"TI FU by using Google Maps
This was a cluster fuck, never using google maps again for off-roading after my experience a couple days ago. My bf (24M) and I (23F) went off-roading in his new Subaru Forester to test how well it off-roads. There’s a lot of Forest Service land where I live, so opportunities were endless. We rushed out the house for my doctor’s appointment, grabbed lunch afterwards, then went out. 

We put our destination in on Google maps for a semi-popular place that’s “supposed” to be just about an hour away. We made a turn that took us off the asphalt road, then made a turn on a different FS road, as directed by Google maps. So far so good. We went through some rocky terrain, and big pile of mud, which legitimately almost made me pass out because I had gotten my blood drawn and thought we were going to get stuck in it, but we made it through. Google then leads us to turn on an another FS road and my god. I see in the distance that the road goes straight up hill at a 50 degree angle, at least. I started getting worried, but my bf, I’ll call him “T,” is experienced in off-roading. It’ll be okay. We keep going down this road and as we get closer, we see that it’s not even dirt going up that hill, it’s just rocks. I start closing my eyes and telling him I really think we should turn around. He still gives it a try anyways. We start going up and the car starts to get stuck. We both agreed that we should turn around and just keep following the road we were just on since we didn’t have a back up person to pull us out. 

We made it back to the road we were previously on, laughing and joking that Google maps is trying to lead us to our demise. We start going deep in the forest, testing out a couple different side roads, it was super fun. We were excited to get to our destination. Then we start approaching some property with an unlocked gate, and when we look down at the screen in his car, Google maps is showing we’re about to be spit out on a popular nearby highway. We were like WTF we were out here for an hour just to be put back onto a highway?! Whatever, we had fun and it was a great chance to test how well his Subaru does. 

We turn on the highway until we reach a county road that maps wants to take us on. We start driving, pull over to take a liberating forest piss break, watch a red-tailed hawk fly close to the ground, yada yada. About an hour later we arrive. We had trouble finding the road that brings you closer to the overlook, so we just went down a little road and started walking. The view was amazing. The place we were overlooking is very popular for tourist, and I’ve been there a lot of times so I feel eh towards it, but seeing it from this point of view was gorgeous. There was surprisingly no one else out there, so we were having a bit of fun, enjoyed the view, then went back to the car. This is where shit really started to go wrong. 

We had been out on our adventure for a little over 2 hours at this point. We put directions in to go back to my house and the ETA seemed to be about the same as it was when getting there, had we not goofed around a little bit. We start driving and driving until we get past this burned area I didn’t quite recognize before. Whatever, keep driving and as we were about to make a turn less than a mile before the highway, a “PRIVATE PROPERTY” sign greets us. We get a bit annoyed because we drove all this way just to run into private property. We turn around and try a different way. 

We passed by this hill that T said would look fun to drive up on sometime. Keep driving, then “PRIVATE PROPERTY.” We get more annoyed but start to lock in and figure out other ways to get out. We find one way that looked promising. We start driving and followed the path thatGoogle reroutes us on. About 20-30 minutes later I see that same hill T commented on. We were led in a giant circle. I start tweaking out. We ran into private property signs again, and again, and again, as well as being directed in another giant circle. 

It was 5:30 PM at this point, we didn’t bring food because we were rushing out for my doctor’s appointment that morning and forgot to grab some after lunch. We felt so stupid because we have outdoor-related jobs. We know better. I start getting really upset and I’m urging T to call his dad since his dad knows the forest well. He doesn’t and keeps driving. We are both exhausted and I’m starting to panic. We thought we were trapped and going to end up seeing slenderman in the trees or something.

Like a knight in shining armor, we see a car coming our direction. I tell T to wave him down and thank goodness the driver was heading back to town and knew where to go. He said that Google maps leads people to a bunch of private property out there and told us to follow him. We drive for about half an hour more before we finally see asphalt again. That’s when we realized, WE COULD’VE STAYED ON THE ROAD THE FIRST ORIGINAL TURN BROUGHT US ON. We didn’t have to make another turn that led us through the forest and to the highway. We didn’t have to take that County road. We didn’t have to do anything but STAY ON THAT FIRST DAMN ROAD. It was 6 PM when we got home. We begun our drive at 12 PM. What was supposed to be a 2 1/2 hour trip turned into 6 fucking hours. 

I will say, it was still worth the view and seeing deer, 100+ elk, a coyote, and pronghorn for, but we are never using Google maps for off-roading adventures again. We are using a physical map and doing research ahead of time.",My bf and I went off-roading using Google maps; we got lost in the forest for hours until a passerby led us out.,My bf and I went off-roading in his Subaru Forester and it was a cluster fuck.

"TIFU by driving a car with a airsoft gun at school
Well as the title implies, I was driving a car with my friends during break at school when one of them decides to lean out the back-seat window and shoot at some random kids. Me and my friend where talking in the front of the car and had no idea what was going on. We all yell at him to stop and we don't think much of it until we get back inside the school and some people say one of the kids went and reported the incident to a teacher - apparently he thought it was a real gun.

We all go into the library until they announce over the PA that the school is going into a ""secure school"" state. Sure enough, the kid that shot the gun gets called into the office followed by me and everyone else in the car. When I walk in I see both principals of the school and 4 police officers. They all interview us separately and get everyones stories. The police then search my car and take the gun which they assume is mine since it was in my car. Eventually, they call everyones parents and say that we are being investigated and are currently suspended until the investigating is finished, up to 20 days.

A day goes by and I don't talk to anyone but then I get news that one of my friends said there was another incident at a separate place, shot by the same guy. We all agreed that the during that time there was nothing loaded in the gun. In general, everyone thinks that the guy who shot the gun will be expelled, I will be suspended since the gun was in my car, and the 3 other kids will be fine. The real problem for me is that since my car was parked on school grounds, they consider that the same as having a weapon on you.

"TI FU by taking a road incident too far
A few hours ago, I was driving home after having coffee with a friend. On the way to drop my friend off, I noticed a car behind me aggressively overtaking and cutting off other vehicles. He quickly caught up, lined up beside me, and tried to force me out of my lane. Since there was a car to my right, I had no choice but to brake to avoid a collision. As he forced his way in, he clipped my front bumper and then sped off.

I chased after him he repeatedly brake-checked me and even tried to push me off the road. Eventually, I caught up to him at a red light, where he was stuck behind other cars. I got out, walked up to his window, and knocked while my friend was on the phone with the police.

That’s when things escalated—he reached for a gun. The moment I saw that, I noped out of there and walked back to my car. As I neared the back of his car, I suddenly heard him slam into reverse. Reacting instinctively, I swung and punched his rear windshield, cracking it, he stopped I got into my car and he briefly tailed us before splitting off while my friend finished the call with the police, giving them his direction.

"TI lied about my sister committing suicide to quit a job
Hi Reddit. As the title says, TIFU by lying about my sister committing suicide to quit a job. Throwaway for obvious reasons.

At the time this happened, I had just quit a job in the Midwest that I was at for three years. I was stressed trying to look for a serving job with a higher wage than what I was at before. I interviewed for a position that offered amazing tips. I was immediately sold. When I started working there, however, I was started on minimum wage, and the compensation was not what I was promised. Tips were mediocre.

The training was extensive -- quite simply, way too much for what I was being offered. I needed a way out. For one reason or another, I constructed a lie in which my sister committed suicide. I am being completely serious. I still have the email.

I was terrified of disappointing them. I don't know why I created that lie, but for some reason, I would have rather made that lie than tell them the truth. I also felt terribly about all the effort the trainers had JUST put in, with me leaving almost immediately after they were done. I'm not justifying my actions, and I deserve the judgment that's sure to come my way, but that's the truth!

They, of course, responded with sympathy. They offered unemployment, to which I denied (I felt guilty!!!!!).

When I went in to get my final check, they were warm and sympathetic. The guilt was so much that I teared up while in there, which they probably interpreted as me being in a dark spot emotionally due to what they thought was my sister's recent passing.

I hope to address these issues in therapy!!!

"TIFU by saying yes to my aunt and losing $11K
This happened a few months ago but I still get stomach cramps when I think about it.

I was buying my first home. I had my financing lined up, found a place I loved, and had already spoken to the seller directly. Everything was moving smoothly.

Then my aunt—who’s a part-time real estate agent—found out and said, “Let me take care of it for you. It’ll be easier, and I’ll make sure you don’t get screwed.” I didn’t even ask for help, but she started calling the seller, forwarding emails, and inserting herself into the whole thing. And of course, she threw in the classic guilt trip: “Don’t you trust family?”

I figured, whatever. If it makes her happy and it’s less stress for me, cool.

Nope.

She completely dropped the ball. Missed an important deadline that nearly lost me the house. Sent me the wrong documents—twice. Didn’t explain anything unless I followed up multiple times. I eventually paid out of pocket for a real estate attorney just to make sure I wasn’t getting screwed.

We finally closed. I was just relieved it was over.

Then I saw the closing statement.

She made $11,500 in commission. For doing… basically nothing. I swear, she showed up to one showing wearing Crocs and sunglasses and spent the rest of the process forwarding emails like a boomer tech support scammer.

And the kicker? No thank-you. No gift. Just a Facebook post: “So proud of my amazing client for closing on his first home!”

Like… ma’am, I was your nephew, not your client. And I basically paid your mortgage for the next three months.

He told me he didn't buy me this laptop for me to just watch porn, he bought it for college and then asked me if I have more porn or college files on my laptop and proceeded to search up all the epub files on my laptop. It was 600+ epub files, but not all of them are smut! But he doesn't know that, I tried to explain but he was freaking out on me, he selected ALL of the epub files and deleted them (it's fine because I had already sent them all to my kindle + I have lots of things saved on my fanfic profiles). 

He said I'm supposed to focus on college and that he will find a way to track my activities and downloads on my laptop so I can't download any more porn. He told me this is why I have bad grades and that he will tell my mom. 

I don't know what exactly he's gonna tell her, I mean he left with the impression that I have like 600+ files of porn on my computer, but I don't.","My dad saw the smutty fanfiction I downloaded on my laptop, deleted it all (600+ files) and now wants to monitor my laptop activity.",My dad found 600+ epub files of porn on my laptop and is freaking out on me.

I'm a trainee and this is my first day on this project. I'm always early to everything, hate being late, so I was up at 5:40am this morning to make sure I was on time.

After being on the underground for an hour, I got to the train station 11 minutes early and looked for my train, but couldn't find it on the boards. Asked the staff, who couldn't help. Tried to call my colleague who was also going, and they didn't pick up.

The time when my train was meant to leave came and went. And eventually I realised that I had got confused and assumed I only had to take one train, when actually I had to change. So I was looking for a train to 'X location' and couldn't see one, because I needed to get a train to Y location and then another train from Y to X.

"TI FU by breaking up and regretting it almost immediately
This might be a long one, but I need to get this out of me. Idek what kind of responses I'm looking for, but this is eating me alive. (Also just fyi english is not my first language so sorry for any mistakes). And as a reminder, yes there's always two sides of the story, but I'm trying to be as unbiased as possible.
I'm a 30yo woman, my ex is m28yo. We've been together for a little bit over 4 years before I broke up end of 2024. 
This relationship was my longest relationship I ever had. It was very rocky, we're both very stubborn and we lacked good communication for the most part. (Be aware, besides what I'm going to say now, yes we still had a very good, fun and loving relationship) I was always very jealous, he was too but I was definitely more jealous than him. Over the first 3 years we had ups and downs with him  making a few mistakes that made me almost break up with him (no cheating in that sense) and my jealousy made him almost break up with me a few times, but we always pulled through. We also had some issues with me needing more attention and physical contact (just like hugs, kisses, cuddling) and him having phases were he would kinda get distant, which obviously clashed with my needs. One day I decided to get distant myself and that's when he became more attentive again, me being happy about it (and closing the distance again, sorta speak), him getting distant again, and so on. I should also mention that I have mental health issues, like depression and anxiety, which I know made it not easy for him since I had a few really bad phases throughout the relationship, but I got on medication and he helped me as much as he could. So in the last year of our relationship we had another round of getting distant and I decided this time I would not 'cave in' so fast. It kinda went out of hand and I kept getting more and more distant bc I saw that he would continue to be more attentive and loving. At some point I couldn't get out of this behavior and I just stayed distant while he became more loving than ever. In hindsight I think I was scared of him going back to his 'old self' but this made me resentful. I was extremely unhappy with the relationship, with it not moving forward (even tho at this point I was the one not wanting to move forward.), with my work, with my body, my mental health, .. I was just so unhappy with everything and eventually I broke up. I cried for days after doing so (which is not like me at all. Like I've always been a person who went like ""ok that's just how it is now and I will move forward"") and was still really unhappy and my depression went into a spiral. He was very understanding and said he would still be there for me and fight for this relationship. We continued to text and see each other alot and he showed me that he still cared alot about me and I realized what a big mistake I made and to this day there's nothing I regret more than breaking up with him. Now you could think we talked it through and decided to try again, since I regretted it and he wanted to fight for the relationship. But that's not what happened. He didn't wanted to act like nothing had happened and neither did I since, yes obviously something big did happen. But as time went on he got distant again. We still texted each other every day but we saw each other less and less and he wasn't as 'loving' anymore. I wanted to be open and asked him if he still wanted to work on it and he kept saying yeah but it's not that easy and he is still hurt over the last year, which I understand and I didn't want to rush him or anything but his behavior just went more 'friendly' than anything. I asked him a few times if he just wanted to be friends instead which he kinda denied and he kept saying his feelings for me didn't really change hes just still cautious. It's been 5 months now, we haven't seen each other in almost 2 months and we only text. Before we've also like played video games together or jus chilled on discord or whatever. Nothing of this is happening anymore. I'm still close with his mom (he knows this) and I visited her a few times the past two months. We talked a little bit about the whole situation and she said he is acting weird and she doesn't think he wants to lose me but also that she doesn't understand what his deal is. I've also tried a few times to tell him that this situation is extremely uncomfortable and that I don't know what is going on and what he wants and I tried to distance myself so that he maybe has room to think about what he wants. None of this made any changes and he just keeps saying his feelings haven't changed but he is cautious bc every time we fight (in my mind we don't 'fight', we have arguments bc I literally feel like I'm going insane in this situation and I just want some clarity) he gets reminded of our relationship and how it was back then when we fought. Like I was there too! I was hurt too whenever we fought. I asked him if he was seeing someone else, he denied it. I asked if he was maybe just relieved that he could casually flirt with people, he denied it. I've been in the hospital for 5 weeks now (5 times a week, for about 8 hours for my mental health) and got diagnosed with bpd. I asked him if he doesn't want to try again bc of my mental health, which I would understand as I know how hard it can be to have a partner with mental health problems. He denied again. I try to distance myself from him, but I keep going back bc I just don't want to lose this man. I thought about moving to a different city because this is literally ripping me apart and I feel like there's nothing holding me here anymore since I got fired from my job as well. And when he got wind of it he said he doesn't think that's a good idea bc I would be alone there and it would be a pity ""but I can't make you stay"" like DUDE, YOU WOULD PROBABLY BE THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD SMH. I know going full no contact would maybe be the best, but honestly I think this would break me completely. I asked him if he was too scared to break the contact bc I could like hurt myself for just don't understand what's going on with him something and I asked if he just wants to keep me warm to see what else is out there and if there's anything better. He denied and denied yet again. I'm at my wits end and I just don't understand his deal. I don't know what else to tell or ask him or what to do at this point. I feel like I broke up the best relationship I ever had and I want nothing more than to work on it and get it back together as a team. I know from this text it doesn't sound like it, but pls keep in mind all our problems where just one part of all those years, and we had a lot of fun and good times and we loved each other strongly. Now I sit here, no job, mental health at its lowest, a new diagnosis, hating me and my body more than ever, feeling lost and broken and like I should've worked through my problems rather than throwing everything away. I'm sorry this got so long but I had to get this out somehow. There's probably a ton of things I forgot to mention that gives more context but I've been writing and rewriting for hours now, and my eyes hurt from crying every single day since the break up.",; I broke up with my boyfriend of 4 years and regret nothing more in my life but now he kinda doesn't want me back.,"I broke up with my boyfriend of 4 years because I was jealous of his attention and affection, but I'm not sure how to move forward from here."
"TIFU and burnt my butt cheeks
This happened yesterday but I’m dealing with the consequences today.

I (F25) have been planning a beautiful spring trip, and it’s some heavy travels, away from home for 2 months. Going to see my boyfriend after some time apart, I live on the east coast and will be on the west for a bit. This trip is a first for me and took a lot of planning. 

My parents are watching my dog for me, they are in Kentucky. So yesterday I left for my first leg of travel: grabbed a rental, loaded mine and my dogs stuff, and hit the road for about an 8 hour drive.

Plan was to leave around 10am, but I woke up at 5am with my monthly (naturally).  Cramps, back pain, general fogginess, the whole 9-yards. Whatever, it’s a part of having a V and mama ain’t raise no baby. 

So I pull up to the Budget car rental as planned, and they give me a car with these nice seat warmers, I’ve never owned a car with them. I run those bad boys at full heat the entire 8 hour drive. Back pain completely gone. Feeling great and cruised the entire way there.

I burnt the crap outta my butt cheeks y’all. Like bright red welts.

TIFU Hi Reddit today I will tell you about how TIFU by locking myself out of my own room and slicing my wrist trying to get back in. You see for context I live in a building that rents out multiple spaces for multiple purposes. I use this space to live. My landlord is great and I quite enjoy it where I stay. I felt really bad ass about installing the lock that I had done the day prior. Little did I know this lock would be the problem that started this whole crap along with my really bad memory. The bathroom is right next to my room so I don’t have to walk very far. I accidentally shut the door, not knowing it would lock. Thirty minutes later I’m almost crying and having a mental breakdown about it. Tried to push open the door to get inside not knowing that the middle panel on my door was made of glass. And I pushed in the glass, cutting my wrist up. I just need to know an estimate oh how much it MIGHT be as I am trying to work this off from my landlord bless his heart. Today’s lesson can be don’t let your mental state cloud your judgment because you can end up playing stupid games and winning stupid prizes.

"TIFU by thinking I could fit through a bunk bed ladder
Ok for context I (29M) am NOT a babysitter. Actually not a fan of kids in general. But a family friend asked me to babysit their seven year old and I need the money so, I figured why not.

The mom gives me freedom of the castle so to speak, just entertain her kid while she’s away for a few hours. The kids playroom / spare bedroom is in the basement. That’s where we spent most of our time. I’m making up games but they’re mostly not connecting because the seven year old is unimaginative and not fun and mostly a little shit. The only thing she likes is when I fake injure myself, or chase her around.

So we’re doing one of the fake chase around things, she dives through the bunk bed ladder in the spare bedroom. I go to follow her. But my shoulders immediately don’t fit through the rungs. “You’re too big!” She mocks. Don’t ask me why, but it rubbed me the wrong way. So against science and reason, I force my shoulders through. It is painful. But eventually my top half is through.

Smugly, I continue forward. Now I am a slim guy, but I have what the kids are calling a WAGON, which didn’t figure into my calculations. It’s stuck on one side, and when I go to pull out, my shoulders don’t fit. I AM STUCK. Fully stuck, panic, sweat, praying. The child is crying laughing, poking me, taunting me for having the hubris to think I could follow her.

This goes on for about five minutes before I have to call a friend. I give her the code to the house, about twenty minutes later she arrives. After taking care of the kid, mocking me, and taking a plethora of pictures, we try to problem solve by taking the ladder of the bed. No good. We can’t work it up or down. And no amount of Jergens helped either.

Eventually we cave and have to call the mom. We tell her we are considering calling the fire dept. she zooms back home, busts out the saw, and cuts my adult sized butt out. Needless to say word has gotten back to my family and I will forever be shamed.

[Previous post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/s/HBgYs1I2VX)

Last time I was here, I accepted a job at a gay bar and ended up losing my gf because of it. I continued working there because the tips were actually not bad. I'm still doing the same job, but this time my brother is working with me. I got him the job after he made me aware that he needed work. He was fresh out of high school and willing to do whatever he had to do to pay for his weed and shit. He had a gf, so I felt compelled to remind him that my relationship ended when I made the same choices he did. He believed his gf was more open minded and less insecure than my ex. A couple of weeks after my brother accepted the job, his gf broke up with him. Photos surfaced on social media of my brother working at the gay bar and apparently people online were roasting my brother's gf for dating a guy who's showing his ass to other guys for money. 

My brother denied the version of events I heard and wanted me to believe his relationship came to an end due to unrelated reasons. Whatever the reason was, it was his first breakup and he was sad as fuck. Our coworkers eventually complained to me about my brother sulking all the time and low key making them feel like they were somehow responsible for his gf leaving him. I decided to introduce my brother to my female customers. I thought maybe some attention from the opposite sex would keep his mind off of his breakup. Little did I know that I would end up losing all of my regular female customers to my brother. The ladies loved him. They wanted the twink not the twunk. According to my brother, they literally said that to him. I took the hint and kissed my tips from the girls goodbye. I'm making less money now, but at least my brother seems to be enjoying his work.

This just happened and I can't breathe. 

I have a silly bedtime routine which involves putting my kids to bed and and then going to use my toys in the restroom.
Well, tonight, things were going as they normally do. I started the dryer, and got to work. This time though, I put headphones on. These headphones are insanely good. In fact, they were so good, that I didn't notice my dogs barking as my mother in law walked in for an unplanned stay. 
Cue her walking in on me right as I'm about to cum. No worries though because I was able to save myself a few seconds of embarrassment. I only realized she was here once she was already in and had a nice long vue of my naked self. She just looked at me, turned off the dryer and said she heard it banging across the house.

I didn't hear her walk in due to headphones i was wearing and it took me long enough to notice that she got a clear glass vue of the show. I now have to live the rest of my life with this event. 

Eta: headphone brands are beats studio pro.
I particularly suggest if you have adhd and get over stimulated by noise. Sometimes I wear them without even playing anything just for the quiet and peace they bring 

Eta2: for those commenting about the link, I searched up the headphones to make sure I had the right ones and noticed they were on special, so I posted it in case anyone was interested. Yall are reaching for absolutely nothing lol

Final eta3: I'm having a hard time keeping up with comments so I think I'm done here. There were a few that came up a few times so I'll just copy paste my response to those: 

Yes my MIL is psycho and my husband isn't oblivious to it. He doesn't defend her or try to justify her actions. He also believes the shit she pulls is completely fucked and has mentioned her behaviours as psychotic. If he tries to shut them down they don't give a flying fuck and just keep going over him. but again, life's hard and we're stuck where we are right now. 

Ans for those who don't think its real: 
I don't understand what is so difficult to believe it's not that wild. 
Husband has lower drive than I do, which leads me to using my toys most nights.

"TIFU by thinking I was finally getting smart with my money
About two years ago, I hit that phase where you suddenly realize you have no idea what you’re doing with your finances. I was watching all those “how to escape the matrix” videos, reading Reddit threads about how fiat is dead, the dollar is trash, and how real wealth lives in silver and crypto. And for some reason, I fully bought in.

I took about $4,000 — which, for me at the time, was a lot. Half I used to buy physical silver coins from some website with a bald eagle in the logo. They arrived a week later in a little velvet bag. I felt like a pirate. I put them in a Nike shoebox, taped it shut, and shoved it under my bed like some kind of post-apocalyptic treasure hoard.

The other half? I put into some obscure crypto that was shilled heavily in a “low market cap gems” thread. The guy had charts, terms I didn’t understand, and a wolf profile pic, so obviously I trusted him. Long story short, the token tanked by 70% in a matter of days. A week later, the project’s Twitter was deleted and their Discord turned into a Minecraft server.

At this point, I accepted that the crypto was a bust, but at least I had my physical silver, right? Well. A few months later, I moved out of my apartment. Chaos, boxes everywhere, last-minute cleaning — you can probably see where this is going. I completely forgot the shoebox existed.

Two months later, I randomly remembered it while brushing my teeth. Cold sweat. Called my old landlord. He said, “Yeah… the new tenants cleared everything. Nothing left.” That was it. My silver’s probably on eBay now.

I lost $2K in crypto and straight-up left the other $2K in a cardboard box for someone else to find. All because I thought I was too smart for a savings account.","Got cocky with money, put half into a sketchy crypto (lost it), and the other half into silver coins (left them behind during a move).

"TIFU by leaving my  bluetooth on
to preface this, i (18m) was raised in a very strict christian household. my whole life my parents have drilled into me that watching nsfw content was a sin. however, i do not consider myself religious, so i have disregarded this rule.

"TIFU by trying to recreate a porn move i had no business attempting
So this happened a couple of weeks ago, and I still think about it every time I wince walking up the stairs.

My girlfriend and I have been together for a while, and our sex life is solid, but you know how sometimes you get a little too inspired? Yeah. That was me. One night she was out with her friends, I stayed home, ended up on a certain website for… research purposes. I stumbled on this video where the dude had the girl in what I can only describe as some Cirque du Soleil kama sutra hybrid — she was squatting on top of him while he supported her from underneath in a kind of bridge pose, using just his back and thighs. And they were going at it like it was nothing.

My very average, not-flexible, desk-sitting self thought: “Pfft. Easy.”

So the next night, we’re making out, things are getting heated, and in a moment of misplaced confidence, I say, “Hey, wanna try something new?” She raises an eyebrow, laughs a little, and goes, “Sure, surprise me.” Oh, she had no idea.

I try to guide her into position while getting myself into this pseudo-bridge I remembered from the video. The moment she gets on top, I realize I massively overestimated my abilities. My thighs start trembling almost immediately, but I try to push through it. She’s giggling, thinking it’s all part of the fun.

Five seconds in, my core gives up completely. My arms slip, my back arches in a way it definitely shouldn’t, and I just collapse. She flies forward like a sack of potatoes, hits her shoulder on the edge of the bed frame, and I let out a noise somewhere between a gasp and a dying walrus.

We both freeze for a second, unsure whether to be concerned or laugh. I ask, “Are you okay?” And she just bursts out laughing. Like, snorting, wheezing, tears-streaming-down-her-face kind of laughing. I’m still on the bed, trying not to cry from the pain in my lower back, and she’s on the floor, cackling uncontrollably.

The mood? Absolutely annihilated. Romance? Dead and buried. We ended up lying in bed later with an ice pack on her arm and a heating pad on my spine, watching dumb Netflix comedies in awkward silence. The next morning I had to explain why I was limping at work by saying I “tweaked something at the gym.” Not technically a lie, just… not the whole truth.

Now any time I so much as mention trying something new, she immediately goes, “Wait—did you see it in porn again?”

Lesson learned: those moves are done by professionals. With core strength forged in hell. I, unfortunately, am built like a guy who skips leg day and stretches once a year. Never again.","Watched porn, got inspired by a move way out of my league, tried it with my girlfriend, collapsed mid-sex, she hit the bed frame, I wrecked my back, and now she mocks me every time I suggest anything “new.”","I tried to make out with my girlfriend in a Cirque du Soleil kama sutra, and my core gave up."
"TIFU by thinking the girl I like was pretending to shoot me
There’s a girl I work with that I really like a lot. We joke around a lot and sometimes I think she might be flirting with me, but I haven’t worked up the courage to ask her out. And after today I don’t know if I ever will.

She seemed like she was in kind of a bad mood today. She wasn’t acting rude or anything, just didn’t seem as in the mood to joke around. No worries, I just won’t bother her.

So I pretended to get shot and slumped down the wall.

"TIFU by Reading My Student's Private Crush Confessions in Her Worksheet
So, I'm (32M) an English and Spanish teacher, and I thought I was being all responsible and organized grading papers before spring break. Big mistake.

Last Thursday, my 3rd-period class was knee-deep in *The Great Gatsby*. One of my students (15F) got pulled out of class by a math intern (23 or 24M) to help her friend (17M) with his health class. She left her vocab worksheet on her desk. I decided to grade it later.

Here's where I messed up. I started grading, and I noticed some extra commentary in the margins. Turns out, my student had poured her heart out about her crushes. And not just any crushes, but Jay Gatsby and Nick Carraway. Yeah, the literary kind. She was even writing love scenarios between them. Then she wrote about wanting to kiss a girl in her grade, even though her parents are strict about dating.

It was super personal. She clearly never meant for anyone to see it, especially not me. I gave her an A on the worksheet because it was otherwise fine. But now I'm freaking out.

Spring break is almost over, and I have no idea what to do. Do I pretend I didn't see anything? Do I give her the worksheet back and just ignore the margins? Do I burn it? I'm leaning towards the pretending option, but I feel like a massive creep for even reading it in the first place.

Bear in mind I'm an extreme amateur in the kitchen. I've barely touched an oven, so most of my recipes have been with an air fryer. This is important

Thursday night, I made a batch of brownies, but because I'm a jackass, I took them out of the air fryer after 10 minutes and had nothing but hot batter on the baking sheet. I didn't want to waste the box, so I put them back in the air fryer for another 30. After letting them cool in the freezer overnight, I had a couple for breakfast and bagged up the rest for my friends.

I wrote that they were ""twice-baked brownies"" on the bags because I thought it had a nice ring to it (and I did have to bake them twice). That was fuck-up #2.

At school, I gave out like 10 bags with ""Twice baked brownies :D"" written on the side, completely oblivious to the implications of that statement. Everything was going okay until an SRO (basically a cop that patrols American high school campuses) had to pull me aside assuming I was dealing pot brownies.

I explained myself the best I could and let him sniff a sample of the bag. He didn't detect weed but left me off with a warning saying ""I shouldn't go down that path,"" threatening to take me to the office if I did it again (my school has a zero-tolerance drug policy, and even suspicion of drug possession can get you expelled)

Bear in mind I am a straight-A student with perfect attendance, so that made me laugh",My shitty baking almost got me kicked out of school,"I gave out brownies because I thought they were ""twice baked brownies."""
"TIFU by waiting too long to eat
Well. I was starved this morning and had nothing to make for breakfast, and after moseying around in bed for a couple hours I decided I couldn’t take it anymore. My stomach was rumbling and growling at me while thumbing through Reddit of course. I’d had enough. So I went out for breakfast around 11am and was so hungry when I got my food I ate sooooo fast SOMEHOW I chomped on the side of my tongue sooooo bad I couldn’t even finish my food or my fresh OJ. This was only 4-5 bites in, my plate looks hardly touched. I mean, a chunk of the side of my tongue is MISSING! I guess I swallowed it with the food when I bit it. I’m not sure, but it’s bad enough my tongue actually formed a scab to help it heal. Am I the only only who DID NOT know tongues can form scabs? That’s just wild to me.","I went to breakfast starved, I got my food and a couple bites in I chomp a chunk out of the side of my tongue, rendering me unable to finish my meal or my fresh squeezed OJ.",I chomped on the side of my tongue so bad I couldn’t even finish my food or my fresh OJ.
"TIFU by not canceling an accidentely booked holiday home
Wanted to go on vacation with my girlfriend so we looked for holiday homes in the area we wanted to go to. Found a few interesting ones so we clicked the ""book non-commital"" button on the booking website to ask if the home was available for the period we wanted to go. Or at least I thought it was ""non-commital"". Because apparently we did book that home very much commital. Problem is it took a while until I got the confirmation Email so by that time I had forgotten about that specific holiday home (we looked at some others aswell and in the meantime had found another one we liked and had already booked). 
So apparently I put that mail into the bin folder by accident. Because I never delete emails except ads. Well, that of course was a huge mistake because I never looked into that email and missed the deadline for a free canceling. So now a few days ago I got a new mail. It was the confirmation for the cancellation from the booking Agency. The cancellation was now 90% of the original booking price, 450€. 
I was in shock and called the agency back, explainig we never booked that holiday home and that I never got any confirmation mails. At that point I was still under that impression. I looked into every folder (except the bin) but couldn't find it. They said they would pass that on to the landlord so I could maybe still get a free cancellation or at least one that is less than 90%. Only after that call I looked into the bin folder and found that email. 
The thing is, my girlfriend is a student and I'm doing a volunteer year where I only get 555€ a month. So for me this would pretty much be one months pay for that one mistake. Now I can only wait and Hope that the landlord says ""OK fine"" and we don't have to pay. That would be amazing but I doubt it.
But hey, you learn from your mistakes, I guess. Never delete emails.","Accidentely deleted the booking confirmation mail for a holiday home. That lead to me Missing the deadline for a free cancellation after we got another home, so now I probably have to pay 450€ for a late cancellation.",TIFU by not canceling a booking.
"TIFU by drinking gin
I went to a restaurant with my partner at 5pm last night and i’m a pretty light drinker… I usually like to order 2 cosmos or lemon drops and that USUALLY gets me lightly buzzed, same goes for 2 beers. Well they had “spritz” ( I did not know this meant it was gin I am 23 and barely drink) and it wasn’t till I was on my second one that I realized it was gin and that was just the beginning for the horrible time. I have never felt drunker, the second we got home I projectile vomited everywhere and could barely do anything. My partner was just doing their best to help me not freak out because I get freaked out whenever i’m too fucked up, and I passed out for like 5 hours and here we are. 

I woke up 10 minutes ago and just feel so icky and hungover, it should definitely go away soon in the early morning, but i’m curious to know if anyone has a gin story. I am never drinking two gin drinks again and i’ve only ever had this bad of a drunk when drinking whiskey, dark liquor in general, or too much beer. I’m very surprised two fun cocktails
 would traumatize me this much","TIFU by drinking two gin drinks, what’s your experience with a horrific drunk",I got super drunk and projectile vomited everywhere
"TIFU by underestimating a chihuahua
for context, i am petsitting this weekend— a 3 y/o chihuahua and an inside-outside cat. earlier this week, i met the owner (a family friend) and both pets, and the introduction went well. the chihuahua, Nala, of course made a big scene when i got there, but the owner said she calmed down relatively quickly compared to when meeting other strangers, and we took things very slowly the rest of the visit. she sniffed me a few times but never let me touch her— still, overall a win for a chihuahua, right??

when i got here today, i let her out of her crate and offered treats, as instructed. she wouldn’t take them and instead ran over to the door and began barking/whining, which i had been told was the signal to let her out. now, this was when i had the realization that Nala wasn’t wearing a collar, nor was there any leash in sight. i remembered that the owner never mentioned either of those, and that when she let her outside, the dog was off leash. so, i decided to just let her out (mistake #1). instead of turning right towards the back yard, she turned left, scampering into the driveway. i followed her and thankfully remembered the owner mentioning that Nala LOVES car rides. so, i opened my rear drivers side door and she immediately hopped inside. success! i then gave her a few minutes to settle down while i brought all my stuff inside. twice, i offered her a treat, just placing it on the seat next to her, but she refused both of my olive branches, leaving them there to send me a message (the message was clearly received and all it said was f u).

now, this is where i very naively underestimated how upset and afraid she was. by this point, it had been sevvveral minutes of her barking her tiny head off in my backseat and i didn’t want the neighbors to think i was attempting to steal this dog. so, i just decided i was going to try and grab her and carry her inside. like, i really thought she was just going to struggle and bark the whole time and that it would be loud but mostly fine. nope!!! the second i reached toward her (mistake #2), she chomped down on my hand, so i backed up, rolled the car windows down a bit, and closed the doors while i went inside to clean up my hand (she definitely broke skin but honestly not bad as far as dog bites go).

while inside, i thoroughly washed my hand with soap and warm water. i then called both my boyfriend and best friend for moral support, calmed down a bit, and looked around for the THICKEST blanket i could find. once i found my blanket/weapon of choice, i worked up the nerve for what i had to do next. i then calmly but confidently strode out to the side of my car she was sitting on, opened the door, and threw the blanket overtop her. there was certainly a struggle (god i wish someone had been there to video me wrestling a thrashing chihuahua under a blanket😭😭), but i managed to secure the blanket around her and carry her back inside without sustaining any further injuries.

it has been a few hours since the incident and she still won’t come near me, but in general, all is well. i haven’t made any advances, just calmly moved about the house, making dinner, doing laundry, and now watching tv in the living room. she has mostly sat on top of the couch, looking out the window like a wife wondering when her husband will return from war and occasionally whimpering.

despite the rough start, i do have hope she’ll warm up to me as the weekend progresses!! i’ve dogsat plenty of times but never for a chihuahua (or any aggressive type dog) so any tips from those with experience are welcome :)","my weekend of petsitting got off to a rough start when i let the dog out to go to the bathroom, ultimately resulting in a minor hand injury and bruised ego",i underestimated my chihuahua’s reaction to being let out of her crate.

TIFU by spending 36 hours straight in a 3x3 box with no light for 2,000. It was a bet and I only got water. No leaving no communication besides a few check ins to make sure I was okay. I was Locked in from the outside so i couldn’t really leave. I did end up making it but not without a full mental breakdown. Now I’m very anxious constantly. Hour 0-2 I had my first panic of the challenge, heart racing, bone crushing anxiety when I realized I had to sit in the box for 36 hours straight. There was no difference between eyes open and eyes closed. I went in at 8pm so I was able to sleep from 10pm until 8am sleeping in the fetal position on concrete once I was able to calm down but little did I know what I was in for. I woke up with the same death gripping anxiety as the night before and From 8am until 8am the next day I didnt sleep whatsoever and each hour was grueling slow. At hours 14-16 i cant really remember much besides only wanting to get too hour 18- the half way point. Once I was there I just wanted to make it too 24 hours the 2/3 point.

By hour 24/36 I had my my final major panic attack realizing that I still had 12 hours left and I was mentally broken beyond anything I have ever experienced. Even when I was down to hours 8-6-4 there was no mental rest. The anxiety just got worse because now the anticipation of getting out was all consuming, the minutes seemed to take hours, 10 minutes felt like an hellish eternity. I had to take it one second at a time and somehow eventually made it out but not unscathed. All I wanted to do was leave, the money was no longer a factor I just wanted out I was done, I could barley breathe and had the most intense urge too break out but held off.

"TIFU by thinking I was dead after getting my shot and causing a McDonald's worker to think I was insane
I stood in queue in the cruel and unusual March heat for two hours to receive my vaccine shot. After feeling no side effects whatsoever, I decided to go to the McDonald's near the vaccination site.

I stood in front of the one service person in there silently for a bit, when she looked up and asked me, ""You are dead?""

I thought I must have misheard. This is the chaos that then ensued:

Me: Huh?

Service person: You are dead?

Me: Excuse me?

Service person: You are dead?

Me: Come again?

Service person: YOU. ARE. DEAD?

Me: No! Why would you think that of me?

She then went to the cash register and said, in a thick West African accent, ""Can I take your order?""

An hour later I got back to the hotel and it dawned on me what had happened: The poor woman had simply asked me over and over again if I had ordered.

""You ordered?""

I was just too woozy from the heat to really filter through the accent. It sounded exactly like ""You are dead?"" She must have thought me a complete imbecile.

"TIFU by accidentally congratulating an NBA player on the loss of their child.
(This happened many years ago, but I've never shared the story, and of course I won't share personal details nor are they important to the story).

I was excited one morning to see that a fellow parent (and NBA player) of our preschool was at morning drop off. It was a rare occasion to see them or have a chat as their wife was almost always present instead. They were always a very friendly family and we had a healthy casual acquaintance that often brought short conversations in passing.

As I greeted him I suddenly remembered that I hadn't seen him since hearing the big news of their newest child being born.

ME: Hey \_\_\_\_! Congratulations!

THEM: (Nods with that obligatory pulled back smile we all know)

ME: (thinking: something seems off. Maybe I wasn't specific enough) So happy for you guys. Do...

TEACHER: (Interrupting me and whispers into my ear) Hey, they lost.

My eyes go wide. That crazy sinking feeling hits me and I freeze. They check into attendance as I turn to the teacher with a look of terror and embarrassment and the teacher, with a look of you-sad-stupid-donkey whispers to me,

TEACHER: They lost it last night.

A physical reaction takes over, my eyes fill up, and I fight to keep my voice as stable as possible. I turn back to them,

ME: I'm so sorry. I'm. I'm so so sorry.

THEM: Thanks. (Nods with that small obligatory smile again, and begins walking away.)

I turn back to the teacher grasping my forehead.

TEACHER: Are you ok? (with a confused look, insinuating that I may be overreacting).

ME: ...I can't believe I just congratulated him.

TEACHER: Haha. That's ok. I think he's just pretty sad.

ME: Well, I would THINK so!

TEACHER: Well, they did get pretty far, but that game last night was the end of the playoffs for them.

...

At this moment I experience a sensation that could be best described as a mental explosion. And I am currently sitting in a tangled mess of misunderstanding. I have completely neglected the NBA playoffs, had no idea about the game, am completely off the hook for my blunder... and most importantly realized that their new baby is perfectly fine.

ME: (with tears on my cheeks) So, they didn't lose their baby?

TEACHER: What?! ... No!

ME: ...

TEACHER: Oh my god...

ME: (crashing back to reality. Sobbing while laughing somehow, I squeezed out the words) I'M NEVER TALKING AGAIN!

TIFU by forgetting my dentist appointment... and somehow making it worse.

So, I had a dentist appointment scheduled for this morning. Totally forgot about it. No alarm, no reminder, nothing. I was blissfully unaware until I got a ""You missed your appointment"" text.

Panic mode engaged. I called them immediately, apologizing profusely, expecting to just reschedule. But nope. They hit me with, ""This is your second missed appointment, so there’s a cancellation fee.""

At this point, I was already pissed off at myself for forgetting, but whatever, I accepted my fate. But then—because my brain was clearly not functioning today—I tried to joke about it, saying, ""Well, at least I didn’t forget to brush my teeth!""

"TIFU by gardening and ending up smelling like a coyote litter box
For context, I (41, F) live in the Midwestern United States, enjoy gardening and deal with small woodland animals who think l'm planting a buffet for them. I use hunter's ""predator spray"" (read ""aerosolized coyote piss"") to 'mark my territory ' without hurting any of Bambi's friends. The scent effectively let's them know to keep it moving without stopping to graze. Let me tell you.. no good deed goes unpunished

This happened today. Picture it, the most unseasonably beautiful weekday in Match. I'm unexpectedly off work amd have nowhere I have to be. I set to work in my garden. Repotting, sowing seeds and transplanting. Listening to good music and just generally feeling it. It's been a dark winter, and this is great. After a few hours, I survey my work and feel satisfied.

"TIFU by screaming “fist emoji, American flag emoji, fire emoji” during the height of intimacy with my girlfriend. And it ended the relationship.
So, yeah. This is as bad as it sounds.

Lately, I’ve been completely absorbed in reading about SignalGate, the absolute disaster that is the second Trump administration, and just the general dystopian nightmare we’re living through. It’s been consuming my brain space. I’ve been doomscrolling, reading deep dives, listening to political podcasts. The whole thing has been weighing on me to the point where it’s probably not healthy.

Fast forward to last night. My girlfriend and I are… in the moment. Things are getting heated, we’re in sync, and everything is building up to the crescendo. And then, right at the peak, my brain short-circuits and, instead of anything remotely sexy or even just normal, I shout:

“FIST EMOJI, AMERICAN FLAG EMOJI, FIRE EMOJI!”

She immediately stops. Just freezes mid-motion. Then she looks at me, completely expressionless, and says, “Did you just yell emojis at me?”

I instantly realize what I’ve done. I try to explain, but there’s no explanation that makes this better. “It’s just that I’ve been reading about the news a lot,” I say, which sounds like the worst possible excuse in this scenario. She just blinks, sighs, gets off me, and starts putting her clothes on.

The room is silent except for my overwhelming regret.

We had a very brief, very awkward conversation where she basically told me she’s already been feeling like I don’t live in the moment, and this just kind of confirmed it for her.

"TIFU by Withholding My Entire Paycheck in Federal Taxes
Last month I was on top of the game with filing my taxes early. I'm the primary earner in my family, but my spouse also has some occasional contract jobs, and for simplicity we typically just use my withholding to cover our total taxes due. However, last year we had several irregular sources of income that brought in more money than usual but which don't withhold taxes (serving as election workers, participating in research studies, etc.). We hadn't adjusted for these or made quarterly payments and so ended up owing a couple thousand dollars - and for the first time ever, a small amount of penalties and interest. (Hence why I filed early to minimize those.) The underwithholding was a mistake, but no biggie.

So being a responsible citizen, I then went to the IRS calculator to figure out how to adjust my withholding for this year so that we get things right given our assumptions for this year. I get the numbers, pop them into a new W-4 in my employer's payroll system, feeling good. 

Two weeks later, I notice that my paycheck hasn't hit my checking account and think, ""Huh, that's odd."" So I log in to look at my paystubs and see on the summary screen a long line of previous earnings, but then ""$0.00"" for the most recent. After a mini-freakout that perhaps I was Milton Waddams, had been unknowingly been laid off and someone ""fixed the glitch"", I clicked for more details and found the issue. 

On top of the new $617 in Federal Tax (up from the previous $396.58, fine), there was also EXTRA Federal withholding of $4,364.11. Umm...

So you know that new W-4? Turns out that instead of inserting $4,528 on line 4(a) ""Other Income"", I had entered it on line 4(c) ""Extra Withholding"", completely ignoring the big bolded warning that this was additional tax I wanted to withhold each PAY PERIOD. 

The kicker? Not only did I give the federal government an interest free loan this year, have to file a new W-4 (triple-checked this time), and crimp my cash flow (we'll survive), but since there wasn't enough to cover the unnecessary withholding, my retirement savings contribution was suspended... meaning I didn't get my employer match either. While I can technically make up the missed contribution, I can't recover the $262 match, which compounded at 7% could be worth something like $1,000 by the time I retire in 20 years. All because of a data entry FU.","I put a four digit number in the wrong box of my W-4, resulting in my ENTIRE net pay being withheld in taxes last pay period, and costing me the contribution and employer match to my retirement account for added insult to injury.",TIFU by Withholding Entire Paycheck in Federal Taxes.

**""Ooo bhai!""** he yelled again, grinning like he had just discovered fire. I turned to look at him, completely confused, and that’s when I realized—he thought I was trying to impress her. And of course, she looked at him, then at me, then back at him, probably connecting the dots in the worst way possible.

I stood there, confused and slightly pissed, while he grinned like he had just ruined my entire character arc.

I decided I’d plan a surprise party and propose to her at the party in front of our friends and family. 💍 Ambitious, I know. The past few weeks, I’ve been sneaking around organizing everything – I bought a ring, conspired with her best friend, and even had secret calls with her parents to get their blessing. I was so excited and sure it would be an epic surprise.

The fuck-up began with all the secretive behavior this required. I’m usually an open book, but suddenly I’m hiding my phone, texting people behind her back, and making up lame excuses to duck out of the house (“Uh, need to run an errand… bye!”). I thought I was being slick to avoid spoiling the surprise. In reality, I was acting sketchy as hell. Her best friend (who was helping me plan) messaged me something like, “Can’t wait to see you to go over the final details 😉” while my girlfriend was borrowing my phone to play a song. I snatched the phone back so fast and pretended it was a work message. 🙄 Mistake. At that point, I officially raised every suspicious red flag possible. I could feel her side-eyeing me the rest of the night.

Over the next few days, I noticed my girlfriend getting quiet and anxious. I tried to play it cool, but I was often rushing off to take calls from the party venue or whispering to her friend about party prep. She started asking me strange questions like “Everything okay between us?” and I just nervously laughed it off, which only made me look guiltier. I was this close to the finish line, so I figured it would be fine once I pulled off the surprise… if I could avoid looking like a cheating jerk for two more days.

Well, last Friday it all came crashing down. I came home and found my girlfriend in tears, holding my iPad. Pro tip: if you have Apple devices, they all get your iMessages. 😬 She had seen some of my message exchanges with her best friend about “the plan” and “keeping it secret.” One out-of-context line from me said, “I can’t wait to finally do this. It’s so hard to keep lying to [Girlfriend].” (I meant lying to her about why I was busy, but ohhh my god, out of context it looked BAD.) She confronted me sobbing, thinking I was having an affair with her best friend or something. She was shaking, my heart absolutely dropped into my stomach, and I started panicking trying to explain, “It’s not what you think!”

It took me a solid minute to get her to stop yelling and listen. I was literally on my knees – not exactly how I planned this – trying to calm her down and tell her the truth. I said, “I swear, I was lying because… I’m planning a surprise for you. Please just open that closet.” She was confused (and still sniffle-crying) and opened the closet… where I’d hid the birthday gift bag with the ring box inside. She turned back to me, and I just blurted out everything: the party, the proposal, how her friend and parents were in on it, and that I’m an idiot. She went from angry crying to shocked crying, and finally started happy crying once it clicked. I ended up officially proposing to her right then and there on our living room floor, because why not at that point! Not the grand romantic tableau I envisioned, but the ring made it onto her finger. 🥳

She said yes (through lots of tears and a half-laugh at how absurd the whole situation was). We just sat on the floor hugging each other, both kind of trembling – her from the emotional rollercoaster I put her on, and me from narrowly avoiding complete disaster. Later on, when things calmed down, she did kind of scold me: “You dummy, I really thought you were cheating! You scared me!” (Fair… I feel like a total jerk for putting her through that.) We also had a laugh when she realized her best friend’s “😉” texts were about cake and decorations, not secret hookups. In the end, we decided to still go through with the birthday party that night and act like the proposal was a surprise in front of our friends. It was awkwardly hilarious because everyone but her thought she was genuinely surprised when I got down on one knee – they had no idea she’d found me out beforehand. We haven’t told that part of the story to our families yet; that little fiasco is just between us (and, well… now the internet).","I tried to plan a surprise birthday party and proposal for my girlfriend, but my secretive planning made her suspect I was cheating. She discovered some “evidence” and confronted me in tears. I had to reveal the surprise (engagement ring and all) earlier than intended to prove I wasn’t a dirty cheater. She’s now my fiancée, and I’m never planning a surprise like that again without a cover story!",Made my girlfriend think I was cheating on her when I was actually planning a surprise party.
"TIFU by ""making"" cousin and relatives stop visiting?
This happened recently, and I’m still dealing with the fallout. Every holiday, my cousin (32F) comes over, and I hate it. She’s always been toxic from passive-aggressive comments, judgmental looks, making everyone uncomfortable. My family insists we put up with her because “She’s still family. and family comes first, Hamada.”

This time, she was worse than usual. Every word out of her mouth was some smug insult mocking our house, our clothes, even the most random things just to feel superior. I was this 🤏🏻 close to snapping, but I kept my mouth shut for the sake of peace.

Then, she dropped the most diablocal line:
“Wow, you actually look like a terrorist. If I saw you on the street, I’d report you.”

I finally lost it and said the simplest and cutest thing i could say to her: “Mind your own business, Bitch.”

But... Silence.

For the first time, she looked shaken. The arrogance drained from her face and she just sat there, speechless. Then, in classic dramatic fashion, she got up, yelled something incoherent, and stormed out.

I thought that was the end of it. Nope. If it was, i would have grabbed a coke and moved with my life.

Within days, we were practically blacklisted by the family. No one visited. Friends stopped checking in. I found out she went full victim mode—twisting the story to make me look like the villain, and of course, everyone believed her.

The worst part? Even my own family blamed me.
“All of this is because of you!”
“You should’ve handled it better. Look what you’ve done to us!”
Bla bla,

They know she’s a bitch. They know she loves stirring drama. But they needed a scapegoat, and apparently, I was the perfect one.","My toxic cousin came over for Ramadan, insulted everything, then joked that I “look like a terrorist.” I clapped back, and she lost it. She ran off, spread lies, and now my whole family has turned against me. And none wants to visit us",Cousin is a bitch.
"TIFU by laughing at my date for being a mime and having a dad who lives in Iraq
I know this title is all over the place but it was a disaster of a date and I feel both parts play a pivotal role in why.

Today I got lunch with a girl that my friend set me up with. I was told that she’s cute, sweet, and single. I was not given any more information about who this person was and to be honest I didn’t really care. I was just excited to go on a date with someone.

My friend gave her my number and she texted me to set a date and time to meet up. We decided to get lunch today. She was very cute, and very sweet, a bit soft spoken but exuded confidence. We start telling each other about ourselves and the first 15 minutes or so goes great. We were laughing and joking and having a great time.

Until she told me that when she was a kid, she wanted to be a mime, and would often dress up in the whole getup and act like a mime. I don’t know about you guys, but that struck me as being objectively kind of funny. Like, I would never judge anyone for being a mime, but it’s a little bit silly and I thought I was being told so I could laugh.

Well, I started laughing and she immediately went straight faced. I didn’t think she was actually upset though, her expression seemed exaggerated for comedic purposes and I thought she was pretending to be upset so I could laugh at her. It sounds stupid and really douchey, but at the time it just seemed like she wasn’t really bothered, and we had kinda teased each other a bit before this point.

I dug the hole even deeper by standing up and doing the invisible box thing, mind you we’re in a public cafe, I don’t know why I thought it was a good idea I just thought she’d start laughing or something since, again, I thought she was purposefully pretending to be upset. She started looking around and was visibly embarrassed, and that’s when I realized she was actually unhappy with me laughing about her being a mime.

I sat down and apologized profusely and she just kind of nodded and said it’s fine. I felt really bad, and honestly just kind of embarrassed. I think she realized and started to try and comfort me, and I said I deserved to be embarrassed because what the hell was that? We kinda started to laugh at how absurd the situation was and somehow we managed to get back to a conversation that wasn’t super awkward.

I asked her where she was from or where her parents were from. I could tell English was her first language but she had a slight accent. She said her mom is Polish and that’s where her accent is from, and then she started talking about her mom and how she’s a great woman and raised her and her 2 brothers and she specifically said that her mom “taught her everything”. 

Immediately after that she said “and my dad lives Iraq”. And I laughed.

You might be confused why I laughed. I know she sure was.

She said: “why is that funny?”

I said: “You said your dad lives in Iraq. That’s funny”

Her: “How?”

Me: “Obviously he doesn’t live in Iraq, I thought you were making a joke?”

Her: “He absolutely can and he does. My mom raised us on her own”

Me: “I’m sorry I’m not trying to insult you or your mom. I just don’t see how it’s possible that he lives in Iraq. I thought you meant like he lives under Iraq”

Her: “What the hell are you talking about?”

Me: “Your dad doesn’t live IN Iraq. You were joking right?”

She excused herself after that and didn’t say anything else to me. I was scratching my head wondering what I did wrong, until later when I told my brother and he was able to enlighten me to how much of an idiot I am. Her dad lives in Iraq, which I have always pronounced and heard pronounced as eye-rack, not er-rock.

I thought she was saying her dad lives in a fucking rock. Which would obviously not be possible and why I was so confused that she was upset at me for laughing. Especially since she just said her mom “taught her everything” so I thought she was saying like “my silly dad doesn’t know anything. He doesn’t just live under a rock, he lives IN a rock!”

But now I just feel like an asshole for laughing at her and practically calling her a liar when she said her dad abandoned her. I tried texting her but I think she blocked my number. I’m gonna try to get my friend to tell her at work that I’m not the biggest jerk in the world, just maybe the biggest idiot.","I laughed at my date for being a mime, not knowing it was a sensitive subject, then I laughed at her saying her dad lives in Iraq because I thought she said he lived in a rock",Laughed at my date for being a mime and having a dad who lives in Iraq
"TIFU by accusing my friend on being transphobic
My friend made a comment in a gc I’m in about someone in her family transitioning and that she would have to “burn another part of the family tree.” This sounded to me as if she was against the family member. Multiple more comments were made about “it” being “sick” and it making her upset. 

Another person in the gc began agreeing with her and at this point my nerves were boiling as I have a sibling who is trans and I am very close to them. I did text back in the group chat about not appreciating hateful speech on the topic.

I texted her privately to ask why she would make hateful comments knowing that I was included and had a trans relative. (She had been previously aware of this too). She responded saying she supported the LGBT+ community but hated the fact that she couldn’t speak up to her family because they did not.

At that moment I had realized my mistake and profusely apologized. I clarified in the gc where my anger and confusion was coming from and apologized to the other person who had agreed with her.

I want to crawl into a hole and never come back out- I feel so bad that I didn’t put it together sooner and made a small scene over a misunderstanding.",thought my friend was being transphobic and got mad at her.

"TIFU by screaming profanities during a football match in front of my elderly neighbors.
I’ve always been known among my elderly neighbors as a humble, quiet kid who keeps to himself and doesn’t really care much about the world around him. But today, I completely ruined that image.

Like every other evening, I went out to play football with the neighborhood kids. It’s one of the few times I step out of the house, so people don’t see me around much. Everything was going fine until two of my teammates started making crucial mistakes. One of them made a terrible pass straight to an opponent, which led to a goal.

As the captain, I completely lost it. I pride myself on having a high tolerance for anger, but when I do reach my breaking point, there’s very little difference between my rage and that of a hungry lion. I cursed at him brutally, yelling, ""Khankir phut, khelti ayos kita korti? Ita korle barit boiya nuntu chus tora!"" which translates to, ""Fucking assholes, why do you even come to play if you’re going to do this? You might as well stay at home and suck on d*cks, bitches.""

The problem? There were elders sitting nearby, watching the game. And I was loud. Really loud. Nobody said anything to me at the time, but I know they heard everything. In that one outburst, all the years of respect I had built in the neighborhood seemed to disappear.

Now that I’m back home, I can’t stop thinking about it. The guilt is eating me up. I don’t know what the elders must be thinking of me now, and I have no idea if word will reach my parents by tonight. If it does, I’m screwed. Wish me luck.","Lost my temper in a football match, cursed loudly, elders heard—reputation ruined. Parents might find out.

"TIFU By Slitting my Penis on a Car Door
I should preface this by saying that there is nothing sexual about what has occurred, and there is nothing remarkable about my penis, but I have nonetheless managed to injure it in a rather unfortunate manner.

So I went to grab lunch, and while saying hi to a couple of passers-by, I leaned across the roof of my car while closing the door, and since I was wearing some rather airy shorts, and I somehow managed to smack said door against my crotch as it was passing, resulting in me, mid-wave, exclaiming ""Oh fuck!"" and doubling over in front of several people.  
  
I wasn't sure how to handle this situation, so I had to just go about my business like nothing happened.  Upon inspection, there has been a non-insignificant wound to the area. There is now a 1-2cm long slash across my right ball and my penis. Pray for me.

"TIFU by drinking orange juice with a side of spider
This happened last night at around 2am. I was half asleep and reached over to grab a drink of orange juice from the cup on my nightstand—just a little sip to feel something before I passed back out.

I take a sip.

Feel something move on my tongue.

Think it’s ice.

It’s not ice.

It keeps moving.

I instinctively grab it out of my mouth and chuck it across the room.

It’s a big spider. Still alive. Staring at me like I interrupted its late-night plans.

I freak out, kill it, and then just sit there on the edge of my bed completely awake—mouth tingling, soul shattered.

In that moment, I fully understood the meaning of Katy Perry’s “Wide Awake.”

"TIFU by forgetting my license
Today, i had my 6th driving test, yeah ik its bad, ive gotten 1 serious for ALL of them. Thats not the bad part. What was, was realising 20 minutes before the test that i took my school ID not my provisional which then my mum drove going 120mph home to collect it and back. This included past cop cars on the other side. I called the test centre and the dude said yeah you can do the test if you get here in like 3 mins as were getting there. I made it. But while driving into the centre, my mum overtook a learner at the entrance to the centre to quickly let me out. The centre stated they will report her to the police for dangerous driving. I also failed this test with 1 serious. I told her to just leave it, not do the test, before she was speeding which infuriated her more. Its understandable as i do pay for it, but she does the bulk of the work finding test dates for me. I feel disgusted i caused this problem, for being so bad at driving i didnt pass, and i couldnt even despite all her stress atleast pass for her this time :( and on top of that if she also loses her license, then neither on us can drive",my stupidity made my mum get charged with reckless driving,TIFU by forgetting my license.
"TIFU by cheating on my bf with his “best friend” over text
Throwaway account since my bf knows my main. 

I’m diagnosed with depression and I’ve had it for 5 years. I am a woman and I have been dating my boyfriend for over a year. While this didn’t all happen today, it happened just yesterday, I couldn’t really function well after it all happened so I’m posting now.

Yesterday around 4:00 I got a snap on Snapchat of my boyfriend’s (who I’ll call O) best friend (who I’ll call M) as he took a selfie of himself. He has two best friends and M is one of them. 

I opened the snap and took a screenshot of him to send to my friends because it was a dumb selfie. He decided to strike up a conversation with me, all of this is on O’s Snapchat acc btw, saying he was M. 

We just talked about normal things back and forth since he said O was busy at his sports practice and M had his phone for a while. 

He started bringing up sex and sexual things. I tried changing the conversation twice from that but he kept bringing it back. Eventually pressuring me to talk about me and O’s sexual life. He asked if I was a virgin or if me and O had sex and said he felt sorry for O since I didn’t fulfill his sexual needs. 

I stupidly kept playing into it, responding mainly with questions and flirtatious talk since I did find M attractive briefly months before during me and O’s relationship, and O knew about that. 

The conversation progressed from him flirting with me to him saying he would have sex with me and that he has wanted to for a long time. I kept asking questions and now the conversation is super vague to me. 

I won’t lie, I fucked up because I said sometimes I am a little horny for M and that if I wasn’t dating O, I’d probably have sex with him. I really wouldn’t, I have no idea why I said that since I never have thought about M that way. 

During this whole conversation, I was sending my friends some screenshots and basically texting them stuff like, “wtf is going on” but I kept talking to him and I kept going along with it. 

Eventually M started practically begging me to send him a nude and when I wouldn’t, he said he would send me one of himself as long as I sent him one after. He kept saying things like “just do it, it feels so much better after you just do it and it’s out there” and I kept saying no. 

Eventually he sent me a nude of his own and I didn’t really know how to respond. I said something like “nice dick idfk” and M asked how it was nice and I responded with something like, “I would say because it’s big but I don’t really care about size.” I feel like a fucking idiot looking back but too late now. 

M continued to pressure me into sending a nude and so stupidly, I did. It was an old photo and I wasn’t naked in it, it was just provocative so not technically a nude. 

After I sent it, M screen recorded it and then took a screenshot, then texting me, “loyalty test.” I then received a snap of my boyfriend saying something along the lines of, “guess who was here the whole time” and mocking me. 

The whole time, it was O texting me pretending to be M while M watched the whole thing. I then texted O over messages saying we’re over. He said “no we’re not, I at least deserve you to say it to my face.” O then drove from his sports practice to my house and came in COMPLETELY uninvited. Making sure I’m specifying that completely. 

He practically broke in and I repeatedly told him to get out over and over again. My parents weren’t home at the time. I ended up doing self harm again after being clean for almost a year while he was driving to my house and that’s when he walked in. 

O ended up sobbing in my bed next to me, I was already crying when he got there. O kept laughing and crying and asking why I would do it, saying that he thought I didn’t like M and that I promised. He took my phone and texted my friends on my phone saying “She fucking cheated on me.” 

Eventually he went to my bathroom and I snuck out of my room to my parent’s bathroom so he wouldn’t know where I was. I basically sobbed on the floor, texting my friends. Me and O started texting and eventually he found me laying down on my parent’s bathroom floor. He talked to me but I didn’t say anything back. He brought me bandages for my self harm and he left to go back to my room.

I called my mom. I called her for about 10 minutes, telling her the main story but not all of it. She didn’t think either me or O were in the right but she became pissed when I told her that O wouldn’t leave. My mom told me if she didn’t hear from me in 15 minutes that he was gone, she was going to come back and kick him out herself, and that’s the last thing he would want to happen. 

I came back to my room and told O that he needs to leave. He said he would’ve left earlier if he knew I wasn’t going to hurt myself and he said that he will gladly leave. I tried to explain myself to him about what happened but it was useless. O laughed at me and said he doesn’t understand how I think I’m even remotely in the right, then he left. 

I sobbed for a long time, texting my friends and I called my mom for about an hour, she helped me a lot. I told my friends a summary of the whole story and they’re on my side. My mom is obviously on my side, she doesn’t consider what I did cheating. 

No one except me, my bf, and M knows what fully happened until I post this. Before O left, he left a note for my brother (since they hung out a lot), my family, and me. I crumpled it up and threw it. 

My stepdad came into my room as said that if O ever comes into our house uninvited again, he’ll leave in a body bag (lol). 

I don’t know what to do, I really don’t. I haven’t ate since that happened and I haven’t gotten out of bed since I threw all of the gifts O had gotten me either in the trash or in my closet, sobbing the whole time I did it. Now, I haven’t gotten out of bed since I woke up 5 hours ago and I’m writing this.

I also hate this because I have a lot of classes with M and in my longest class, he sits right behind me. He’ll never look at me the same. 

Me and my bf broke up for less than a day but now we’re just kind of on break, it’s complicated. 

I don’t know why I truly did it but I think I might’ve figured out a couple reasons after talking to my mom. 

I think I mainly did it for the thrill because I was bored of me and O’s relationship, there was no thrill in it anymore, no excitement. I also might’ve done it because O never really had pleased me sexually. I also struggle with my self image, so when “M” complimented me on my looks and personality, it made me feel good about myself. 

Those are the main reasons why I think I did it but it doesn’t really matter now. If I could go back and erase what I did I would but I can’t. 

Me and O wanted to get married and start a life together. I still love him a lot but I don’t know if I should still be with him, I don’t even know how long it’ll take my mental health to recover from this. If you read all of this, you’re a trooper.",I texted my bf’s best friend and he pressured(?) me to send a nude and I did. It turned out to be my bf the whole time and now he thinks I cheated on him. We’re now on a break and I’m not doing well.,I cheated on my boyfriend with his “best friend” over text.
"TIFU by finding out I’m not truly a girls girl
A bit long, but:

Back in July, I (22F) got a new coworker (23M). I’m not the type to put myself out there, but I definitely look, and hey I was looking. He was fine as fuck. We immediately hit it off with friendly banter and continue to get to know each other throughout the next couple of months. 

Our work group is very social and very involved with one another, always making plans or lingering as most of us live close to our job site. This means we have extra exposure in between working and living, so our work-life areas clash quite a lot. Two of my coworkers are even dating. Anyways, this man and I are getting friendlier. He’s giving me compliments left and right about how good I smell, my choice of style, my knowledge and humor, everything to make me feel a type of way. Of course I play back minimally, I’ve never been one to make myself overly obvious. 

A week or so into October, a bomb drops that he apparently has a girlfriend?! What the fuck? So I reevaluate, distance myself from flirting and continue being just friends and limit my hanging around the workplace when it’s just him, right? I don’t want to cross any boundaries. Come Halloween, I throw a pregame before we all go to the same party together. He’s invited of course, and he shows up late with his girlfriend. No one would’ve had a problem with that if:
1) he communicated he was going to be late and 
2) he had said he was bringing his girlfriend 

A lot of people may think it’s only natural she’s invited, however, this man NEVER talked/talks about his girlfriend and no one had ever met her, knew her name, or known anything else about her. It was a complete jumpscare, but of course I jumped in as host and started making her feel welcome. She actually had the coolest and most simple Medusa costume I think I’ve seen and she looked great. I spoke with her for like 15 minutes or more when they came in and got to know her and she seemed so cool and funny, but a little weary already of women (or was that me being competitive?). Either way, she was welcomed, we all drank and drove to the party and had a great night.

Flash forward, that’s one of the few times I saw her. Only recently has she been popping into the workplace more, and every time she does, we all make sure to say hello or a greeting, but she lowkey pays us no mind, only there to speak with her boyfriend. I get it, but manners? Every time she comes by, my coworker gets annoyed or seems frustrated. One time he straight up told her “you give me the ick.” 

Even though he’s been in a relationship all this time, he continues to flirt. I don’t think I reciprocate. I have plenty of issues on my own and he isn’t even in my top 3 choices of men, but that doesn’t mean he’s not my friend, he’s not fine and we don’t vibe. This brings us to last week. 

Last week, everyone was in a mood to hang out and drink like normal, except half the group bailed last minute. My coworker tends to go to a different home further away at times and when we plan these nights, he stays closer. He stayed closer that night, so we decided to drink, smoke and play some light video games for the night with one of my best friends. I had two beat boxes and was feeling nice before the blunt, and he had 6 ipas, a rum and coke and a blunt. My bestie is a light weight and was lowkey gone by 3/4 of the way in. She soon would fall “asleep” on the floor while we were smoking and watching some stoner show. 

Then it starts. His hand lingers as he’s passing the blunt. He shifts his leg to just barely touch mine, where I can feel the heat of him through the fabric of my leggings. His hand falls when I grab the blunt and his hand lays on my thigh, right above my knee. He gives me the lightest squeeze as I slowly lean back up to take a drag off of the blunt he had just handed me, still feeling his hand lingering as I stare into his eyes that were gazing at me for any reaction. 

I stopped and asked him what he was doing. He said what he felt he wanted to do, he was doing what’s been on his mind since he met me. I reminded him of his girlfriend. 
I said, “you have a girlfriend.” 
He followed that with, “I know, it’s complicated. I know I want you.” 
I asked him, “what am I supposed to say to that?” 
“I don’t know. We don’t have to think about her.”
“How can you not think about her right now?” 
“All I can think about when you’re around is you. I feel numb with her, but you, you bring me to life, you awaken my feelings.” 

(Awaken his feelings??????) 

So I told him. “I’m a girls girl. I can’t. Not when you have a girlfriend. That’s not right. I’m not gonna be the person that makes you a cheater. I don’t want to be. I don’t want to be the other girl.” Or something right along those lines. 

But guys he was getting closer. 

And then I diverted to my friend on the floor. I could not believe he was saying all of this with my best friend literally “passed out” right there in my floor. And so I start going to her. It’s already almost 3am at this point, so definitely time to wrap up. I try to wake her up and she struggles to actually get up to go to her room and that’s when I know, she was faking the whole time and heard everything. She always gets up to go to her room after a night, no matter how bad she’s gotten and she wasn’t even that down bad. I picked her up to walk her to her place in my same building (lucky I know) and he was getting his stuff together to follow me. When we get back he forgets something inside and then uses the bathroom. The show is still going and he asks if we can smoke another one, and goes on to light it up. He gets closer and I’m not gone gone, but I’m much more receptive and you guys, he’s so fine. I kept bringing up his girlfriend and he told me to stop. I told him we’re gonna have to call it a night if he doesn’t stop advancing. Meanwhile I’m gone but coherent. His leg and mine are still touching 🤦‍♀️ 

In one fell swoop he gets closer, and pulls up chair right in front of him. This causes me to stumble just the slightest bit and I kind of stand to gain composure. He stands with me and grabs onto my waist to keep us both steady. This puts us right in front of each other,  me shocked by what just happened. And him looking down into my eyes literally an inch away. He starts leaning in and I’m frozen between wanting to stop it and wanting to reciprocate. He asks why I’m not moving, his lips so close to mine I can feel the air around his formation of words. He asks why I haven’t backed away. He asks why I’m holding onto him back. Why I haven’t broken eye contact. 

I tell him I’m not going to do anything, that this is his choice, that I’m not making it for him, my voice barely a whisper as to not make so much movement to close the gap. Silence ensues for what had to be 15-20 seconds of us just staring at each other, just barely moving, our lips dancing a touch less dance before he made his decision and mine. 

It was like everything from the year built up, all of that tension releasing in a 3 and a half hour session of gentle caresses, freaky positions and attention to detail. I’ve never felt so secure when I was naked in front of a man, and lemme tell you, this one lowkey takes the cake. We finally stopped right as the sun was rising and fell asleep spooning, his girlfriend back on my mind as I start to realize what I’d done. 

We wake up the next morning. It’s casual. It’s normal. My best friend doesn’t know. Last she heard was me saying no and standing true to the girls girl code. And I failed. Now it’s been a few days, the next work week is coming and I’m afraid. As I should be. I’ve never been this person. I always thought I’d be better, that I was better. Now I feel like crap because what if it were me? What if it were my partner who cheated on me? I hope to god she never finds out, and that he simply breaks it off with her soon/eventually. Not for my sake, strictly for hers. I don’t think I’m anything to be jealous of, but I know comparing yourself to anyone hurts, especially when they were chosen over you. I broke one of my own rules, and I’m just so disappointed in myself. And now I have no idea what the fuck is about to happen.","new coworker came in months ago, never talked about his gf.

"TIFU by buying the new Barad-Dur LEGO build
I was super excited for this to come out, and so I ordered the Barad-Dur LEGO build without checking the size.  I mean, it has Sauron and the Nazgûl and all kinds of cool stuff!  How could I possibly have the fortitude to resist that?!

Anyhow, the build was delivered today and I now realize this thing is gonna be fucking HUGE!  Like half a meter wide by 80-ish cm tall.  Our place is pretty small...  I don't know where we can put it!!  (Like think 80m^2 apartment.)

"TIFU by burning my hair oil
I was just going to make another batch of rosemary oil to add to my hair growth oil, but I left it on for a bit too long.

It wasn’t even for that long though, it was on med-low heat for about 20 minutes and I left just to twist the front of my hair, then I was going to turn off the heat and leave it out to cool overnight.

Well, I barely started when my mom texted me telling me she smelled burning, so I ran over and the rosemary was all black.

I turn off the heat and open a window cuz it’s a little smoky but when I moved the pot to another stovetop it like??? Exploded??? There was a burst of fire and the smoke got worse, and screamed and jumped back cuz it startled me.

When my mom came over and put it in the sink, the smoke got even worse and began to fill the whole apartment.

We put up a bunch of fans and opened all the windows, and as I was in my room sitting next to my window my mom said we might have to spend the night somewhere else while the smoke cleared, so she called her bf/ex-bf idek.

Annoying but whatever, it’s my fault, I should’ve been paying more attention.


Only, now she’s in the bathroom with the window WIDE OPEN, it’s 1:30 in the morning and she’s screaming at him at the top of her lungs holy shit.

idk what their problem is, I've never met the guy, but from the arguments they’ve had otp, I don’t like him.

Either fucking way she’s yelling about really personal private shit and when I tried to knock on the door to tell her that she just mouthed “HOLD ON” really aggressively and slammed the door on me.

If any of our neighbors are awake or were woken up by her yelling this shit is so embarrassing, she’s the type to really care what people think yet goes and yells every time she’s otp without ever thinking about her volume, like I don’t wanna hear that shit.

I should’ve just waited till the morning to make it when I was less distracted by other things, now my throat hurts from the smoke inhalation but it’s starting to clear up. 

Now I still have to twist my hair and I have to buy more rosemary. 

Also, I might have indirectly caused my mom her bf, but again, I don't like him.","I burned my hair oil and my mom planned to call her bf so we could stay somewhere else bc there is A LOT of smoke, but now she’s screaming at him otp even though it’s 1:30 am and all the windows are open.","TIFU by burning my hair oil, left it on med-low for 20 minutes, went to turn off heat and left it out to cool overnight, opened a window and my mom called her bf/ex-bf idek, now she’s in the bathroom with the window open and"
"TIFU by ignoring a crackling headphone and blessing the bus with my taste in music.
I listen to music when catching the bus. Headphones occasionally crackle or fail on one side. I don't mind listening to crackling headphones for a while until they permanently fail.

I bought a budget phone. It was decent enough but had a weird QA issue; the headphone port was a bit oversized, which caused some headphones to not fit tightly and crackle as a result.

Another weird software QA issue with the phone was that if the headphone connection was loose and crackling, then it would play music through both headphones and speaker at the same time. I only noticed this when I removed my headphones after stepping of the bus, and heard the exact same music playing through the speakers.

I got a few weird looks on the bus that trip. I blessed the bus with my taste in music:

* I Wanna Be Famous - Total Drama Island.
* Ed Edd n Eddy Theme Song.
* Coconut Mall - Super Mario Kart Wii.
* All My Exes Live in Texas (slowed reverb)
* Blame Canada - South Park.
* Frosty The Snowman - Gene Autry
* Roses - Outkast.

"TIFU by using dishwashing liquid for washing vegetables. It's dangerous.
So for context:

Last year I was in the ICU for almost a month and nearly died from leptospirosis which I contracted from the pet rats I used to have, so stupid me and my trauma has been washing vegetables with dishwashing liquid. Last night some got inside the vegetables used for my shakshouka, and I ended up in the bathroom trying to vomit but unable to, with a stomach ache from the depths of Hades, and was ready to call 911. Thankfully it passed relatively quickly because there were residues in the vegetables after they were rinsed, but even those can cause havoc in the body.

And stupid me also didn't research the proper way to clean veggies, and thought that it would help in at least removing bacteria. Turns out it doesn't do fucking shit, and I almost ended up in the ER.

Just sharing my story and hoping that it will serve as a word of caution for anyone who does such foolishness. Rinsing the vegetables with fresh water or using a special vegetable cleaning solution is enough.",Washing vegetables with dishwashing liquid almost landed me in the ER.,Don't use dishwashing liquid for shakshouka.
"TIFU meeting my sister's bf
I agreed to meet my sister's bf yesterday. The bf made me promise not to tell my sister about our meeting. I didn't know what the purpose of the meeting was, let alone why it had to be a secret. I didn't even know the bf to be honest because he only recently entered my sister's life, but he seemed like a decent enough dude based on the couple of times we interacted. Cut to the meeting. My sister's bf thanked me for agreeing to meet him and got straight to the point. He said my sister made him aware that she was ready for the two of them to have sex, but she had no idea he was still a virgin, so he was hoping that I could give him a sex for beginners crash course. 

I did my best to hide how totally unprepared I was to provide sex lessons first thing in the morning, but I instantly remembered one of my dad's lines and I said porn was not a reflection of reality. Just in case he was thinking of going Ryan Madison on my sister. I encouraged him to focus on foreplay. Become the Mr Miyagi of eating pussy. Communication! Jedi master that shit. If you're not using your mouth to provide pleasure, use it to literally ask her what she likes because there's no one size fits all when comes to making people cum. Speaking of size, condoms! If you've never put a condom on your dick, 3 words, process of elimination. Team up with your dick to find the condom that fits. Sex positions! What looks good in porn might not feel good in real life, so do not attempt to burn through every fucking sex position that comes to mind during your first time, it decreases the risk of breaking your dick, at the very least. Stick to the holy trinity for now, missionary, doggy, cowgirl. Whichever order ends up working. 

I paused at that point to ask my sister's bf if he had any questions. Bro unexpectedly showed me a photo on his phone of his dick before asking me if I thought my sister would be satisfied with his size. I almost choked on my coffee when I saw the photo. Homie was huge. I said I had no idea what my sister's preference was, but I think she might be impressed. I noticed that he was uncircumcised and asked if he regularly cleaned under the hood because unclean cocks, big or small or in between, would never impress anyone. He looked confused, so I asked him if he washed his dick like the rest of us. He said he washed his dick, but never underneath his foreskin because he didn't know that was a thing. I guess my face was expressing a sufficient amount of what the actual fuck bro because he suddenly decided to share his back story about how he grew up in a conservative community that not only neglected sex education, but actively avoided the topic of sex altogether.

I didn't have the emotional intelligence to comment on his upbringing, so I advised him to concentrate on the basics like cleaning under his foreskin for starters. My advice prompted my sister's bf to send me several unsolicited, post shower dick pics this morning. His objective was to get feedback from me regarding the cleanliness of cock, which he managed to capture from all angles with his foreskin pulled back. He informed me that he followed my instructions and washed his dick accordingly. As soon as I recovered from the shock of waking up to an enormous virgin penis, I replied with a thumbs up emoji and hoped that was the end of our communication. He responded with an embarrassed face emoji and asked how weird would it be to meet again for a ""progress report"" after he's done sleeping with my sister. I said very weird. I think it's fair to say I've seen more than enough of my sister's bf. 

Tl:dr Agreed to meet my sister's bf, who revealed to me that he was a virgin, which my sister was unaware of, and that he wanted me to give him a virgin's guide to sex. I regretted my involvement after being bombarded this morning with dick pics from my sister's bf, who wanted to show me that he followed my instructions and finally cleaned his uncircumcised penis for the first time ever.",,I gave my sister's bf a crash course in foreplay and communication.

"TIFU by asking my bf for a pic
It wasn't exactly me who FU but I'm so nervous about this I want to vent. My bf has been away for a couple of weeks for a work team building thing. We were talking on the phone and were talking about this rash that he had on his ""neather region"" since before he left, he was telling me it still looks weird so I told him to text me a photo of it so I could take a look. A few moments later I hear screaming and he tells me he accidentally sent it to the group chat they made for this team building thing. In it are 2 company people and about 16 guys from his program, luckily only one girl. He deleted it for everyone on WhatsApp immediately and thankfully it appears that only one of the guys saw it and was cool about it. I have a bit of guilt since I was the one who asked for it.

"TIFU by lending my older brother 20 bucks
obligatory 'this happened 8 years ago'

i (18f) have 3 older brothers. one is 3 years older than me, one is 6 years older than me, and one is 7 years older than me. my oldest brother, who i will call john, struggled with drug addiction for most of his life. he went to rehab 3 times total. he really, really did his best to get help. he would write letters to us from rehab talking about how much he wishes he could stop. but we never stopped supporting him.

anywho, around april 20th of 2017, i was 10 years old. john, who had turned 18 that february, frantically came in my room while i was playing minecraft. he was like ""OP, do you have 20 bucks i could borrow?"" he was VERY frantic and odd looking. i grabbed my wallet with my emergency 20 in it and was like ""uh... i guess?"" and gave it to him. i was 10. i didn't need it. he quickly said ""thanks, i'll pay you back"" and rushed out of my room. i thought nothing of it and returned to my computer.

that night, john came home very late from work (on a school night, he was a high school senior), probably around 2 AM, and woke me up accidentally because the dogs were barking when he came in. so, i just watched him come upstairs, shirtless for some reason, and go into the bathroom. i didn't hear anything and he seemed to be in there for a WHILE. after some time, and no noise, he left the bathroom and went to his room. i went back to sleep.

that next morning, we all woke up to find him dead of an overdose. whatever he bought was laced with an ***insane*** amount of fentanyl. an amount meant to kill.

we don't discuss it, but it's pretty clear to everyone that i gave him the last 20 bucks he needed to get high again. i feel pretty damn bad about it. so i guess this is my love letter to my older brother, my best friend, and my father figure:

sorry i fucked up, dude. love ya",loaning my brother 20 bucks at 10 years old resulted in him being murdered,i gave my older brother 20 bucks to get high. he died of an overdose the next morning.

Great time , it burns going in and it burns coming out . I mean your piss and shit burns coming out the next day . It's fantastic .

I make coffee , I turn on the TV , I sit down and drink some coffee and then , without thinking, I scratch my balls , and it wasn't a quick scratch , I had a good old pre shower morning ball scratch . Then I go back to my coffee . I notice a tingling sensation on my balls , I look at my hands, ohh shit now I can feel it . My balls are really starting to burn now .

"TIFU by letting my boot drive get full
Late last night i was doing some photogrammetry using Canoma in a VM, i was using old aerial imagery to reconstruct 3D models of buildings that have since been redeveloped in the town i grew up in.

What i forgot was my half a Terrabyte boot SSD was getting full fast for some reason, i was planning on fixing it but it seemed a non-issue as there was still 100gb or so left.

I decided to render a quick video of my creation, it's going well and it looks almost exactly what i saw when i was a kid, that was, until the VM just crashed.

I don't mean it BSOD'd, i mean the hypervisor itself crashed, which is werid, but not uncommon, luckily i'd saved my work, but was annoyed my render would have to be done again, it said the cause was Disk0 becoming full, which i stupidly assumed was the VM's virtual drive, i tried to save the machines state but it became frozen and i had to use task manager to kill it.

That's when i found out, 0 bytes free on drive C, i rebooted my computer, freed up around 30gb by deleting VM snapshots and things i didn't need anymore.

However, that's when i discovered that explorer quit working, now it just says ""working on it"" in a blank window, loading really slowly til it stops, i managed to get CrystalDiskInfo open and it reported all drives were good, so not a dying drive.

Worse, my VM also seems bunk, and there was unbacked up work in there, VBox says the file is empty, i tried to make a new VM using the same vdi, and it goes to boot my copy of Win2k then says INACESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE","I let my SSD fill up, now explorer doesn't work so i can't free up any more space and my virtual machine may have got corrupted, may have lost unbacked up work","Canoma VM crashed, explorer doesn't work, wat do?"
"TIFU by not getting anti-glare coating on my glasses
TIFU. I (M-late 40s) tend to go cheap on my glasses and don’t pay for anything except the UV coating. Normally it’s not a problem. Sure periodically can see my eye reflected in the lens but no problem. My glasses also do a good job of reflecting my computer screen in zoom. Again, I know it, no problem. Here’s the FU.

At the conference talking to a work colleague (F-mid-20s) between sessions and run into a tech question. I pull out my phone to look. She’s standing in front of me. No one behind me but a wall.

"TIFU By telling my mom my brother's biggest secret
I (14 F) spilled my brother's (16 M) biggest secret. A secret that he entrusted to me (but I didn't want to keep, anyway).

Yesterday evening, my mom called me downstairs, asking if I would like to go on a walk with her. I saw that she was already getting the dogs (Noodle, Shadow, and Gemelli) ready for a walk, and I didn't want her to be taking all three of them on her own. So, even though I'd already gone on a pretty nice bike ride earlier that day, I agreed.

Not even two minutes into the walk, my mom asked me if I knew if my brother was vaping. At first, I was reluctant to admit that I knew because he's my brother, and if I told, our relationship would be ruined forever. 

After some coaxing, I finally let everything spill. I told her that he vapes very frequently, even in the car while we're driving to and from school. (He drives us in case some of you are confused). I told her that his friends also do it, and how he ignores me every time I tell him not to do it in front of me because it gives me severe headaches. (I'm getting one now just thinking about it).

Not only had he been vaping, but he'd also apparently stolen alcohol from our parents' little stash in our garage. He'd been spreading that his most recent ex was spreading ""lies"" about him, trying to get him in trouble. Only thing is that those ""lies"" were all true. On this walk, I was getting more and more anxious, to the point where my stomach was clenching up and I thought I was going to puke. (I'm a very anxious person, but I don't think I've been this anxious since my ex-best friend started bullying me back in 7th grade).

My mom, being the person she is, was rambling on about how disappointed she was, asking why God gave her such a loser of a son, and admitted to considering calling the police on him. Honestly, I understand where she's coming from. My brother never learns from his mistakes. My parents have always been too soft on him, so it's only natural that sending him to prison will slap a big fat reality check on him. Not sure if it's important, but he's also on the spectrum. Not very high, but still on there.

When we got home, I went straight to my room. Half of me was relieved, while the other half of me wanted to cry my eyes out. My brother and I hated each other growing up, and we were just now getting along. I was even starting to consider him a friend as well as a brother. Now, knowing him, he'll never forgive me for this. It hurts, but he needs help. 

When my brother finally got home, all he'll broke loose. My mom was on him like a predator on its prey. The screaming wouldn't stop. I was huddled up in the corner of my room, YouTube on full volume, trying not to cry while I talked with my best friend. (Side note, my bestie boo is the best person ever. She was comforting me and trying to distract me the entire time, and I love her so much).

In the end. My brother had his license taken away, his phone and gaming console taken away, and forbidden from going anywhere but home after school. He hasn't spoken to me since. I can't even bring myself to look at him. I can't tell if I feel an overwhelming amount of guilt or relief, but I know for a fact that I haven't felt overwhelmingly anxious except for when I'm with my best friend. I don't feel safe at home. I don't feel safe at school. His friends scare the living hell out of me, and I don't trust that my brother won't do anything when we're home alone this weekend. I don't know what to do. I'm stuck. I've avoided being anywhere alone except for in my room, and even then, I've tried to stay on call with friends just in case.",- What do I do?,"I spilled my brother's biggest secret on a walk with my mom, and now she's considering calling the police on him."

Me and my lovely wife are staying in the big Vegas for a few days, and this evening, I decided to go down to the Flamingo for some good ol' fashioned gambling. The wife was completely on board with all this, and she would go see her girlfriends who'd happened to have been in Vegas as well, so all was well!

"TIFU by accidentally gifting a Twitch gift subscription
So this actually happened yesterday but I just got word from Twitch earlier today so unfortunately I am unable to get the money back. Here's what happened. I was watching a streamer and I notice on the ""gift a sub"" button said ""35% off"" I clicked on it to see the price and then I hovered over the gift 1 sub button. I then accidentally clicked the button and it started to gift a sub. In my panic I closed the browser thinking it would stop the process. It didn't. So now I'm out $6.60.

Now you might be thinking that's not that bad, (unless you hate the streamer). Unfortunately, if you view my posts that I've been posting on another subreddit, you'd know that I had testicular cancer back near the end of 2024, and I am still getting treatments to this day. With how high medical bills are, (yes I have insurance but that's not enough sometimes) that $6.60 could have been used to pay my bills.

I asked the streamer if they could try to refund me but they don't know how. Also, with it being a gift sub and not a money donation, Twitch was unable to help either. I would try to refute this because I used PayPal but I fear that my twitch account would be suspend/ban. So moral of the story please be careful what you hover over and also if you can help it make sure you get rid of your payment information after you are done purchase what you want so you don't accidentally purchase something you do not.

It didn’t look like it had just been liked, but liked for a bit. I had never seen this photo before, but I am fucking mortified. I unliked it and blocked, but if I had liked it before I am cooked.

"TIFU by asking for a ""Spikey Mikey"" in Greggs
Hello Reddit, just some context, I haven't visited a Greggs location in the UK since before the pandemic, and  figured since I was on a rush for dinner the other week I'd quickly nip in and get myself a steak bake and a sausage roll. Soon as I walked in I remembered how I used to always pester my mum for a 'Spikey Mikey', and if you're unsure as to what that is, it's essentially a star shaped biscuit coated in chocolate, used to have a smiley face on but I think they've since swapped it for sprinkles. Walked up to the front of the shop and asked for a sausage roll, steak bake, and a Spikey Mikey. The fella behind the counter goes to grab the sausage roll and steak bake, but gives me some sort of funny glance like I'd spoken another language to him. Says something to me along the lines of ""What was that mate?"" I reiterated, albeit in a rather shaken tone for a Spikey Mikey, started to even doubt if this treat even existed. The bloke working there said that he doesn't ""know what I'm on about???"". Thankfully there was a kind old woman who remembers the glory days behind me in the line who says that they've went and changed the name to a ""Star biscuit""? By this point the queue has doubled in size and I'm getting rather embarrassed, walked out of the shop with my dinner and finished it but the whole ordeal rubbed me the wrong way. Don't know whose bright idea at the Greggs management was to rename it, it was a charming brilliant name and they've gone and ruined it.","Asked for a menu item at Greggs that has since been given an inferior name, kind old lady in the line had to inform me of the name change","Asked for a Spikey Mikey in Greggs, was told it was a star biscuit coated in chocolate."
"TIFU by Trying to Moral Police My Cousin's Arcade Theft and Starting a Family War
So, the other day we hit up the arcade, right? Me, my wife, my sibling (who can be a real piece of work sometimes), and my little cousin, who's around 12. Arcade was the usual and we managed to win a decent chunk of tickets.


Then came the gift shop, which, you know, is basically a magnet for kids with sticky fingers. We were all distracted, trying to figure out if any of the cheap toys were worth our mountain of tickets. It wasn't until later, when we were leaving, that I saw my little cousin happily eating a chocolate bar. I just casually asked where she got it, and her answer was super vague. Turns out, while we were busy with the ticket counter, she'd slipped it into her pocket without paying.


So, being the responsible adult (or so I thought), I pulled her aside and was like, ""Hey, you gotta take that back. You can't just take stuff without paying."" Simple, right? Wrong. Instead of, you know, agreeing that stealing is bad, my other cousins, my own sibling, and even my wife were all just super chill about it. ""Oh, it's just a chocolate,"" they said, and then they actually started sharing it. I was standing there, completely dumbfounded.


I was already annoyed, but I figured I'd deal with it later, when it was less of a public spectacle. Enter family dinner. I tried to have a calm, quiet word with my cousin about why taking the chocolate was wrong, trying to explain the whole honesty thing. And that's when my sibling just completely lost his damn mind.


Out of nowhere, he’s screaming at me. Like, full on, veins popping out of his neck screaming. Telling me to ""shut the fuck up"" and throwing around all sorts of lovely insults. We were legit about two seconds away from throwing down in the middle of dinner. Seriously, the tension was insane.


Honestly, the whole thing just blindsided me. I was trying to do the right thing, teach my cousin a basic lesson, and suddenly I'm public enemy number one, getting verbally assaulted by my own sibling while everyone else just watched. I got super emotional, felt totally unsupported, and just went back to my room.


So yeah just decided to mind my own business from now on.","Caught my 12-year-old cousin stealing chocolate at the arcade, tried to correct her, and ended up getting screamed at by my sibling at dinner while the rest of the family acted like I was overreacting. Lesson learned: my family has a weird moral compass, and I need to stay out of it. Feeling pretty done with the whole situation.","Tried to Moral Police my little cousin's Arcade Theft, got verbally assaulted by my own sibling while everyone else watched."
"TIFU by recording the audio of someone having sex in my building
I woke up at 1AM to a woman screaming. My first instinct was that is was from a domestic disturbance and I got out of bed to try and identify where it was coming from. Around 5 minutes in, screams of ""Yes!..Yes!"" informed me that my first instinct was wrong and someone was having a good time. A really good time. I mean, this was like nothing I had ever heard before. It sounded like a porn video. Based on the crowd that lives in my building, I'm pretty sure no one would be playing porn that loud at 1AM and that this is the real deal. My building is pretty soundproof as well.

In my groggy stupor I felt like something extraordinary was happening that I wanted to capture, so I decided to record the audio on my phone.

In the morning I told my fiancee about the fact that I woke up at night (we live together) and she was mortified that I took a recording. I realized that it was a perverted thing to do but in the moment had no clue. I was never going to do anything with the recordings, nor do I know who is having sex or where they live, but I get that its still weird. Deleted the recordings but my fiancee wants me to talk about this in therapy.",I recorded the audio of unknown neighbors having sex and my fiancee is creeped out.,TIFU by recording the audio of someone having sex in my building.
"TIFU by insulting my online friend in the public group chat because I thought it would be funny.
I (18M) has recently made some new friends while playing an online game a month or two ago. They are a nice group of people and we instantly bonded, then a couple weeks later, they added me into the group chat with ten other people.

A little bit of context about me before I continue with the story, this is relevant. I had never had online friends before, so this was my first group. I was always taught about online safety by my parents and a multitude of different people for my entire life, such as don’t talk to strangers, don’t reveal private information, etc. But just recently, one of my school friends had been openly playing and talking with some online friends of theirs and told me that I should give it try. So that’s what I did.

However, I still believed in the whole “stranger danger” rule that I was taught. So while I was talking to my online friends, I lied a lot about myself, such as my name (I use a fake name), birth date, school information, activities, etc. The only thing I did not change, logically, was my age and country, which I kept all the same. In this way, I had a lot of online anonymity, keeping my private life safe while still being myself.

A bit about this group. The way that we joke around and talk crosses that delicate line of “haha knock knock who's there” to “I’m gonna joke about r@ping you and say the N-word even though none of us are black”. I have this trait of mine where I always want to be the clown of the group, to make people laugh and have fun by making a fool of myself to make them happy (this is due to personal life problems but I won’t elaborate further). As usual, I studied the way they talk, behave, and even engage in their vulgar jokes. We always constantly try to one-up each other with how vulgar we were, always making something offensive because we thought it was funny. We also have times were we would just trauma dump about stuff in our lives in the middle of jokes. From all of this, I thought I knew what was considered funny. That was how I was able to maintain many healthy friendships in real life, I don't want to be an asshole while still trying to cheer up the group. I just want to make friends.

Let me tell you about the online friend I insulted, let's call him ""Trevor"". He (17M) and I were kind of close, he's a nice guy, and he came from the Netherlands. I never had a problem with him, except one time where I thought it was funny to play a very loud siren sound on my Soundboard during one of our group game sessions, which resulted in him leaving the call and claiming that I broke his headphones, which I compensated him with some in-game money.

Now, today, the incident. It was the start of the early afternoon and as usual, I opened the group chat again. I said ""good morning"" amongst other things, and then came the joke from Trevor. It went from a ""deez nuts joke"" to ""I hope you get m0lested by a giant monster"". Now, I had just recently learned a Dutch swear word from my brother who lives there, and thought it would be funny to use it because of what I was taught. The word was ""kanker"", which means in english, cancer. Apparently it's common there, so I typed it in chat and posted it. Instead of getting the usual one-up vulgar jokes again, instead, he was pissed. Turns out, my brother may have misunderstood the severity of such a word.

He threatened to block me and said other words, but it was definitely pure anger and disgust, which I understand. But at that time, I didn't catch any of that. I suck at social cues and understanding emotions, which is why I have an autism diagnosis appointment coming soon. He continued to express his anger and then said ""My grandpa died from cancer, this isn't something you should say."" From what I learned, this is the part where we do the venting, there would be some consoling from us, and then came the jokes. Now, this is where I fucked up. I replied back to him with ""Well, my mom nearly died from cancer and she was alright with me using that as a swear word, L.O.L."" I didn't realize what I had just said, until it was already too late and it was posted publicly in the group chat. He was furious, understandably. Told me that I wasn't raised right, that he will block me, and then some other members of the group told me that I fucked up big time. Regarding my mom, that part was true, she did nearly die from cancer and was alright with these jokes.

I deleted the message, not before I may have fucked up more, because afterwards, to cheer up the group, I sent a sped up GIF of Colleen Ballinger's ukulele apology video in the public chat. Luckily, instead of getting backlash for that GIF, some members actually thought that it was a funny respond and their response didn't seem serious. Trevor said that he would still block me anyways, and that our group admin would set up a rules channel to prevent this from happening again.

I don't really know how to apologize in this situation or to restore my dignity. I'm embarrassed of myself and I want to take accountability for my actions, but I don't know how or when. I don't think I might join our group voice chat and game sessions for a while, or talk in the chat until I prep myself up. I fucked up big time, I'm an asshole, because I thought it would something funny. I have never fucked up or ruined a friendship in my life, never insulted any of my friends for a joke because that was not our group thing, or even needed to get into dramas and arguments like this with strangers. I don't know what to do, and I am genuinely sorry for the actions I have caused, I don't have any excuses and I will not scapegoat or put the blame on anybody, it was all my fault.","thought it was funny to insult my online friend for a joke by saying ""cancer"", but turns out it was extremely offensive, then I responded with a bigger offensive statement, possibly ruining our friendship and my public image forever.

TIFU udate: not an update, just needed to add a few things, yes I still fucked up though. Regarding the previous jokes I made in the group, I don’t do the whole one-up joke teasing we do, I mostly just say dick jokes and sex jokes that I found from youtubers. I’m also not comfortable with those vulgar jokes, but if they thought it was funny, I won’t say a word. This was the only time I tried to one-up them, and yes, it was immature and terrible. The people in the group are not monsters, they are all supportive and kind-hearted, but maybe due to cultural differences or different backgrounds, some of them didn’t understand the severity of these jokes. So far, the group is back to normal again as I am typing this, they are back to joking and chatting including Trevor, except for one member who is still insisting the admin to place some rules for the group, to mitigate these jokes. I’m probably gonna go offline from social media to work on myself and grow up, by fixing all the personal issues I have in life and with my connections. I need to be an adult.",I (18M) insulted my online friend in the public group chat because I thought it would be funny.
"TIFU I Bought a $300 Showerhead for the Trash Can
Today, I feel like peeling the skin off my face. Literally. That’s how much I fucked up.

So, I recently went on a trip to Japan. It was a huge deal for me because it wasn’t easy to go. While I was there, I had this rare moment of wanting to indulge in extreme luxury, something I never do. And I decided, you know what? Showers are an important part of the day. I deserve this. So, I bought a $300 showerhead. The technology was super advanced, it felt like peak luxury, and for once, I wanted to really treat myself.

Fast forward to today. I was swapping out the old showerhead, but the new one wouldn’t fit because a piece inside was broken. No big deal, I figured I’d buy a replacement part. But I kept putting it off. First, I told myself I’d go another day. Then that day came, and I couldn’t go. Eventually, after a few days, I finally went out to buy it.

Here’s where it all went to hell.

I had some random stuff I wanted to throw out, some torn pants, other junk, so I tossed them aside. At some point, I put the showerhead down with everything, thinking, “I’ll move it later.” But I didn’t. I forgot. And then, like an absolute idiot, not really looking I took everything out and threw it all away.

And that’s it. I basically flushed $300 down the toilet. Just… gone.

I don’t even know what to say. Have you ever messed up so badly that you just sit there, staring into the void, questioning everything? Because that’s where I’m at.","Went to Japan, splurged on a $300 high-tech showerhead as a rare luxury which is something I never do. Took my time getting a missing part to install it.

"TIFU I think I lost the girl I was dating because of Naruto

I (24M) have been seeing this girl (22F) for about three months and it’s been great, we have a lot in common and the same type of humor. 

A week and a half ago, she came over, and we started talking about anime. We eventually ended up chatting about Naruto, and I asked her who her favorite character was. She told me she’s a huge fan of Sakura, which honestly kind of shocked me because, in my opinion, Sakura’s character pretty horrible and pretty well hated in the fandom. I started to question her a bit, asking if she really watched the show, because I couldn’t wrap my head around how anyone could like her. 

She responded that she’d rewatched it multiple times and read the manga because she liked it that much. I still didn’t understand how she could like Sakura, so I tried to get her to convince me why she thought Sakura was such a great character. Instead, she told me she’d rather not get into it because she thought it wasn’t worth the effort, that it would just be exhausting and it probably wouldn’t change my mind about the character anyway.

At that point, I kinda got heated and raised my voice, getting in her face, trying to convince her she shouldn’t like Sakura because, in my opinion, she was a horrible character worst than shou tucker. Looking back, I was definitely too harsh, but I just couldn’t understand it. She didn’t respond well to that, and it got super awkward. We sat in silence for a while watching tv, and then she said she should probably go.

Later that night, she texted me, saying she wasn’t sure if she wanted to continue things and needed some time to think. I texted back saying she was overreacting and we should just move on from it.

Long story short, I definitely think I might have fucked up. She hasn’t really talked to me much since then, and I’m starting to realize I probably pushed her too hard.","Got in a huge argument with my girlfriend over Sakura from Naruto, yelled at her about her favorite character, and now I’m pretty sure I ruined things.","I tried to convince a girl she shouldn’t like Sakura because, in my opinion, she was a horrible character."
"TIFU by not giving up my seat to a pregnant lady
It just happened.  I was coming back from work and there were couple of train cancelations so the train was full. I luckily got a seat because I was in front. Now all seats are taken and people start standing between the seats. This is where it happened. A lady came and stood right next to my seat. I just glanced at her and she kind of looked at me but not to seem creepy,  I immediately looked away. I started watching something on my phone and then I kind of remembered that the lady looked well for the lack of better word, healthy.  

That's when it hit me that maybe she was pregnant and was hoping I would give up my seat but just to be sure i though I will have a second look. I turned to look at her belly and right after looking at it, I just saw up and saw her looking at me checking her belly out. At this point I was confused if she was pregnant or just fat.

Now I was in a dilemma,  if I give her my seat and she is not pregnant I look like an asshole,  who saw her fat belly and thought she is too fat to stand. But if she was pregnant and I dont stand up, I look like an asshole who didn't give up his seat to a pregnant lady. I remembered the golden rule to always assume someone is fat and never assume someone is pregnant. While I was deciding what to do, some old lady from other side stood up and gave her seat to the lady and announced loudly ""what a time to be alive, where healthy men don't even give up their seat to pregnant women and an old lady in her 70s have to give up her seat."" She didn't say it directly to me but was basically looking at me the whole time. The pregnant lady also said thank you to her and basically made a face at me. 

I promptly got up and offered my seat to the old lady but she wouldn't take it.",- followed the advice that always assume someone is fat and not pregnant.  Got yelled at by 70 year old lady for not giving up my seat to the pregnant lady.,TIFU by not giving up my seat to a pregnant lady.
TIFU by taking my pet for a walk,"Took my pet for a walk, parent freaks out, now she has a parole officer. This happened in July of 2023 and a friend recently reminded me about it so I figured I would post it here. 

I (32, x) currently live in New England with my spouse (37, m) and our 4 pets. One of them is Toast, my 6 1/2 foot long boa constrictor. I have had Toast since she was about a year old, when she could just wrap around my wrist a couple of times. I take her out as often as I can, especially in the summer to soak up that great natural UV light, so she is used to many different situations and is very calm, relaxed, and comfortable around new people, particularly kids.

I only bring Toast places that she is allowed to be, one which we regularly frequent is our local bike trail. We usually get some looks from others on the trail but we tend to keep to our own space. If we stop to wait for a streetlight to change, we keep our distance from other people as I know many people are uncomfortable around snakes. On a particularly beautiful Sunday afternoon we had been wandering down the trail and  when we got to our regular turn-around-and-head-home-spot, I gave Toast some time to sun herself and just take a rest. This attracted a group of curious teens.

The teens were great, very interested in her, took a million photos and asked a million questions. They were very respectful of her comfort level and mine. After some time Toast was starting to show signs of being done with the attention so we said our farewells and headed home.

Cut to Thursday evening when I am getting ready for bed and receive a message from my friend asking me if the article they saw in the newspaper was about me? I was very confused so they sent me an article from a news paper about a snake loose in the area. Sure enough, the photo accompanying the article was taken by one of the teens. My inbox quickly became flooded with links to articles, news reports, and facebook posts from a variety of people who either guessed it was Toast or thought I'd just find it interesting. It turns out that one of the teen's parents saw the pictures and freaked out, thinking that a giant snake was loose in the middle of town.

I spent the next several days making endless phone calls to reassure the local police, animal control, and the Division of Fisheries and Wildlife that there was never a snake at large. This resulted in the local cops saying that, while I did nothing illegal, due to the panic caused and the resources wasted by the state (they sent out search parties for her) that if I were to bring her back to the bike trail or into mine or any of the bordering towns that I would need to call the nonemergency line and inform them. So now my snake has a parole office she needs to check in with any time she leaves the house.",I love my pet.

"TIFU by completely misinterpreting my friend
This happened a week ago.

So I made a new friend, although I did know of him before. Let’s call him Jeff. I knew he existed because my ex has been friends with him since childhood, me and said ex no longer speak, but anyways that’s not important. Basically me and Jeff matched on Bumble and started talking. 

During this time I’ve been in an extremely bad place mentally because I’m going through changes to my medication, which fucks you up for a while. I’ve also been very depressed and trying to sort out some past trauma so, yah, it’s been a terrible time. When me and Jeff started talking we agreed that nothing serious was going to happen because neither of us were in a position to be in a relationship. 

However, Jeff wanted our situation to be sexual and I wasn’t sure what I wanted yet. We were sexual with eachother online for a few days but eventually I wanted to stop, so we agreed to just be friends. Then, the next day after that agreement is where my fuckup begins. 


My silly chemically-imbalanced brain decided that I was attracted to him again and told him so. This was a completely impulsive decision and I was going kinda crazy at the time. He then sent me a photo of himself, and when I snapped out of whatever strange breakdown I was having, I had to tell him I wasn’t actually attracted to him. I let him down extremely gently. I know I was being very confusing with my intentions and I felt bad about that so I sent a long paragraph about how my meds changing has really affected me and how sorry I was about this, and how he’d find someone else much better for him than me.

The next day, he told me he didn’t want to talk anymore because I made him feel ‘disgusting’ and ‘ugly’. 

Unfortunately I was having another weird emotional episode at this time and I thought he was saying that just because I didn’t give him sex he was leaving and didn’t want to be friends, so I sent him a very strongly worded message filled with things I wish I could take back. Just hurtful things. My reaction here stemmed from past trauma surrounding men and sex. I was completely consumed by my imbalanced emotional state. 

He then explained to me that I had honestly just hurt his feelings and that’s why he didn’t want to talk anymore. That day was very confusing as my emotional state was all over the place, but I remember feeling very bad about what I’d said. 

Now that a week has passed and my meds have evened out a little, I feel like the worst person in the world. My depression is getting worse because of what I did. I completely assumed his intentions and misinterpreted him. I just feel like an awful person and I can’t take back the things I said. I’m not sure he’ll ever speak to me again. I genuinely do miss his friendship because when I wasn’t having breakdowns we had some really good conversations.","due to mental health issues/medication changes I said really hurtful things to a new friend when I shouldn’t have, and now I can’t take that back and he might not ever want to be my friend again.

To preface, I have two jobs. Barracks warden as well as the primary reserves. I had been in the reserves for about six years and I did pretty well just going contract to contract. Usually about four months at a time. But after awhile I figured I should probably find a full-time job because there was always a chance that I couldn't renew my contract.

The reserves have been not only a job, but also a passion of mine. It gave me purpose, I always felt like what I did mattered. But the barracks warden gig has just violently SUCKED every ounce of purpose. I was getting depressed. To the point where I was sherking my duties.

I understand that just because I don't like the job, it doesn't give me the right to do it poorly but DAMN! Nothing I did mattered. If I told one of the troops to fix their shit pit room, it would be right back to the way it was the very next day

"TIFU by making an inappropriate joke during class.
This actually happened a few years ago when I was in college, majoring in Design. 

During one of my classes the professor had us do a quick exercise, he wanted us to list various ways we could rebrand an inanimate object. He asked for someone to name an object and the first person to respond said ""Cucumber"", so that's where we began. 

""What are some ways we could rebrand a cucumber? What are some other potential uses for it?""

Well, the first thing that popped into my head was clearly too inappropriate to say to the whole class, but I thought it would be funny to say it under my breath so my friends could hear. 

Big mistake. 

My professor heard something, he thought I had an answer for the question so he asked me what I said. I frantically tried to back out of it by saying it was dumb, he insisted, I refused again, and then a girl who had been within ear shot of me decided to tell him. 

""He said you could use it as a dildo.""

The class groaned, my professor rolled his eyes and said ""I don't think I'm going to write that one down.""

"TIFU by spitting on my bf
I (25f) spit on my (27m) bf and I don’t know what to do.

I got home from work and he didn’t say hi to me so I went to the kitchen to wash dishes and catch up on chores. Ngl I was a little upset he was too wrapped up in some game he was playing on his phone than saying to me but decided not to call it out right there.

He went to the kitchen later to say hi and I told him that I was upset he didn’t say anything when I got home. He told me not to be dramatic and “are you really going to start a fight over this I’m already here” kind of conversation. I shook it off and he asked me if I wanted to play the same game with him on the phone. I said yes and we played a round. 

Halfway into the game (it’s a war strategy game) he wanted to attack a player but I told him I didn’t have enough troops. This set him off and he got really rude for the rest of the game. I told him it’s just a game we should be having fun but he didn’t like how I wasn’t helping him out. I told him I was going to as soon as I got enough strength in the next round. But he was still rude and told me to “do whatever” and that “I’m too stubborn”. 

After the game I asked him what his issue was with me. First of all he didn’t say hi to me when I got home and now he’s letting out all his frustration on the game directly on me. He told me to shush because I was yelling and to relax. I told him no I’m not going to because this is out of no where and I felt disrespected. 

This is where it gets bad. 

He starts laughing at me and telling me there’s no issue he’s just messing with me trying to make it seem like I’m overreacting and that this is a funny issue. I told him to stop that he was being rude and hurting my feelings. He still kept laughing and tried to rough house me to get me to laugh. He pulled me on top of him and I tried to get off. I was so upset and felt so trapped that my first instinct was to spit on him directly in the eye. 

He let me go and told me to get off him. He washed his face and then told me to go to another room. I left knowing I fucked up but came back to the room wanting to talk things out. I apologized and he told me he didn’t want to talk about this. 

I tried pressing a few more times and even asked him if this has a conversation or resolution or anything and he only told me that in order for it to have a resolution he didn’t want to talk right now. 

This was last night. It’s 6am now and he left to work without giving me a kiss goodbye, something he’s always done even when we’ve been upset with each other. 

I know I messed up big I shouldn’t have done that at all. It’s the first and only time I’ve ever done something like this and I’m not sure why. There’s no justification but I just felt so weak that it was the first thing my brain went to for him to take me seriously or let me go or something. 

I’m not sure what to do besides cry. Any advice is there anything I can do to better the situation for either of us?","BF was being rude all afternoon when I got home from work, he tried to rough house me to make me laugh instead but I felt so defenseless that I spit on him.

"TIFU reconnecting with my friend
Just over 2 years ago, I posted a [story](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/s/WAoBStap7j) on Reddit about a threesome I had with my friend and his fiancée. I wanted advice about a confusing moment my friend and I shared during the threesome. I was lying on my back, receiving oral sex from my friend's fiancée, while my friend was on top of his fiancée in what's known as the prone bone position. My friend and I were basically face to face in that position, which should've been at least a little weird, but somehow it was not. The two of us ended up climaxing while staring at each other. As soon as post nut clarity kicked in, I was feeling confused as fuck. My friend seemed equally confused. We low key ignored the homo erotic eye fucking that happened between us towards the end of the threesome, and discussed everything else that made the threesome enjoyable.

When I left my friend's apartment, we stopped communicating for days. I knew one of us had to make the first move. I was willing to be the one, but first I had to ask random strangers on the internet for advice, so I chose r/sex for some reason. The consensus was that what happened between my friend and I might have meant something or it might have meant nothing. There was no way of knowing if none of us communicated. I agreed with the internet, so I communicated with my friend. I sent him a message to ask if we could arrange a meeting in order to unpack how we were feeling. My friend sent me a message back to inform me that he already unpacked his feelings with his fiancée. He said he didn't want there to be secrets between them, so he felt compelled to tell her that it turned him on to see me turned on. 

Based on everything my friend explained to me in one very fucking long message, his fiancée got upset when he was unable to answer her when she asked him if he was sexually attracted to me. His message ended with an awkward apology and an instruction that made it clear to me that his fiancée no longer wanted me to breathe the same air as her possibly bisexual husband to be. I respected my friend's request and kept my distance, but resentment followed when my friend and his fiancée eventually got married without inviting me to their wedding. I gave up on our friendship and moved on. Cut to now. I never planned to use this account again, in fact, I didn't even know it still existed, but it came to my attention recently that my friend and his wife separated, which prompted me to contact him.

I was still hurt that my best friend basically abandoned me, but it was not my intention to travel back in time to the threesome that fucked up our friendship, I just wanted make sure he had enough support. We reconnected on social media after I sent him a DM. We arranged to meet in the evening at a restaurant he recommended. I wanted to keep it casual and meet during the day, but he was like a fucking vampire, never available during the day, so I went with whatever worked for him. The location he sent me didn't take me to a restaurant. It took me to a food truck, which opened up when I arrived and revealed my friend standing on the inside wearing an apron. He invited me inside and closed the truck before giving me an apron and asking me to help him prepare the food we were gonna have for dinner.

By the time we were done preparing our food, my friend explained everything that happened since the threesome. He said his ex wife was insecure and blamed her for forcing him to push me away because the threesome made her feel like something might happen between the two of us if our friendship continued. He said she was beginning to have doubts about getting married to him because she was unsure if she would be enough for him, but he somehow managed to convince her that she was the only person he wanted to be with. However, his ex wife was unable to stay convinced, so she eventually pulled the plug on their short marriage. He said it was probably for the best because deep down he did develop feelings for me. I was like ""bro, did I miss the part where you said sorry for pretending I didn't exist anymore?""

My friend said he was sorry for everything that happened after the threesome, but he was not sorry for how he felt about me thanks to the threesome. I asked him what he wanted me to do with that information and if said information meant that he was now gay or bi or whatever. He said he wanted to avoid labels for now, but he was hoping that I would tell him that I wanted the same thing he wanted. I said if he wanted from me what I thought he wanted, then we definitely did not want the same thing. I said the threesome we had was an enjoyable experience, and yes, it did get a little weird at the end, but I had no interest in having sex with another guy, especially if the other guy was my friend. Cue awkward silence. My friend asked me what I thought of the sauce he added to the burgers we were eating. I said it was delicious.

My friend waited for me to take another bite of my burger before telling me that he made the sauce himself, and apparently it contained ingredients that boosted sexual arousal. I reluctantly swallowed what I had in my mouth and said I had enough to eat. My friend asked if I wanted to hang out at his apartment. I thanked him for the food and said it was time for me to go. My friend nodded like he knew this might happen and asked if things were gonna be uncomfortable between us going forward. I said it didn't have to be. My friend asked if he was allowed to hug me. I said yes. We got up and hugged. As soon as our bodies were pressed together, I could feel his boner. I backed away and asked him to open the food truck. He blamed the saunce for his erection. I attempted to open the food truck myself, but the door refused to open. 

My friend offered to drive me home and promised not to put pressure on me to let him come inside. I asked my friend to please open the fucking door because I wanted to leave. My friend finally showed me how to open the door. Just before I got out, he unexpectedly wiped my mouth with his thumb and said I had some of his sauce on my face. Last thing I saw him do was lick his thumb before I looked away and left. I think our friendship was better off when we stopped communicating. Like, what the fuck.

**TL:DR I reached out to my estranged friend to offer my support after finding out that his marriage came to an end. When the two of us reunited, he wanted us to pick up where we left off a years ago when I had a threesome with him and his fiancée at the time. However, now he wanted it to be just the two of us. I literally had to escape my friend to avoid getting fucked in a food truck.**",,"I had a threesome with my friend's fiancée. We had sex, and I was confused as fuck.

"TIFU by yielding for “too long” and causing series of misfortunate events
So, I’m headed into class and I’m yielding at an intersection, waiting for the cars to either all pass by or come to a stop in the lane that I’m yielding to. Well, someone else decided that I was taking too long and wasn’t paying attention and thought I was about to drive off and just full sent it, hitting the back of my car. This caused me to hit my head on the interior of my car, the first consequence of my fuck up. 

Next, I get in park, throw my hazards on and get out of my car in order to quickly exchange information with the person who just hit me, assess the damage and then hop back in my car, if I can drive it off. Well, I guess since I was in shock, I had completely forgot that my car very inconveniently automatically locks with the keys inside of it, putting me in multiple situations where my keys are locked inside of my car. 

So, I’ve exchanged information with the person who hit me and walk back to my car, only to realize my keys are locked inside of my car with it on. Another issue my car has is that it overheats whenever it idles for too long. So, now my car is stuck in the yield lane of the intersection, locked with my keys inside, still running and potentially beginning to overheat. 

I get ahold of a locksmith and they say they’ll be around in 30-40 minutes… great…… 

So, while I’m waiting, I notice my glasses are crooked and so I decided to take em off and then bend them back in place. And all of a sudden they snap and break. 

I eventually get back into my car and drive it off to the side to let it cool down and just assess everything that just happened and I take a look at the bruise and I’ve got a bulge coming out of my head. It didn’t feel like I got a concussion? I wasn’t dizzy or nauseous at all today. 

On top of it all, I was late to class! Because of course I would be lol.

"TIFU by accidentally cutting a bit of my labia
My hairs down there were getting a bit long, enough to be annoying for me. They'd get caught in my underwear, and I have a THICK bush, so I decided to go and trim them with some scissors. Didn't matter to me how it looked, I'm not really sexually active, just long enough so it doesn't keep getting caught and being a nuisance. It wasn't worth going through the effort of shaving and getting ingrowns and stubble. So I sat over the toilet, started snipping the hairs. Unfortunately for me, I'm an ""outie"", and while getting some of the hairs, I accidentally snipped just a *little* bit of my labia minora. I ended up dropping the scissors in the toilet, screamed a curse word, and now it's bleeding and hurts really bad. It wasn't a big cut, more like a large paper cut, but it's still hurting and the pain kinda is radiating down my left leg.","While landscaping my pubic hairs, I accidentally cut my labia.",I accidentally snipped a bit of my labia minora and now it's hurting really bad.
"TIFU at Work While Dealing with Crohn’s and My Own Stupidity
So, I’ve recently been diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, which means my intestines have decided to permanently operate in hard mode. Flare-ups are unpredictable, painful, and tend to strike at the absolute worst times. To make things even better, I’ve been back in the office twice a week for the past six months or so, which is a fantastic setting for digestive disasters. 

Now, let’s talk about my earbuds.

I’ve had these Samsung earbuds for about two years now, but I never liked wearing them because they never felt comfortable. So they sat in a drawer unused. A few months ago, my parents recommended some super cheap no-name brand that miraculously fit perfectly. I used those instead—until one of our cats stole them. They're gone. Vanished into the feline void.

So, I was back to my ""good"" Samsung earbuds, aka the ones that always felt uncomfortable and I had to adjust. Which, as I would later discover, was my fault. But we’ll get to that.

Last week, I was at the office in the morning when my stomach announced it was go-time. I rushed to the office bathroom, locked myself in the giant handicap(able) stall, and braced for impact. After an aggressively unpleasant session and waiting for the stall next to me to be empty, I got to cleaning the mess. I stood up after wiping—and that’s when my right earbud decided it had suffered enough.

It fell.

Honestly I think it may have jumped.

I didn't even see it fall. I just felt it go out and then heard it land, with a plop… right into the toilet.

And not just any toilet. The war crime of a toilet I had just created.

I was absolutely horrified. I turned around so I could see, because we have to look, right? That’s when I saw it. The earbud was floating. On a giant turd. Literally ON a giant turd. Like some kind of grotesque first-class passenger on the S.S. Oh God No.

And then? Disaster doubled down.

As I stood there looking down and trying to figure out what the actually do here, my glasses slipped off my nose, hit the edge of the toilet, and landed on the floor in front of me. Fuck me, right?

I closed my eyes. Took several deep breaths. Good LORD, it smelled bad.

Of course, my jeans and underwear are still around my ankles. So when I instinctively stepped to grab my glasses, my left foot came down directly on the left lens. Crunch.

I just stood there, pants down, soul shattered. Like, are you fucking kidding me? Come on. So, I bent down, to pick up my mangled glasses. And at that exact moment—

Ploop.

My other earbud fell straight into the toilet.

I was done. The Sicilian in me wanted to burn the entire fucking building down. There was absolutely no way I was reaching into that cesspool to get both earbuds. Let alone EVER putting them in my EARS again. Yeah, fuck that. I stood there feeling like Ralphie. Should I make up some lie about an icicle? That doesn't work in Florida in March. So much for being able to actually READ anything to rest of the day too. I ended up having to leave the office early to go home and get an old pair of glasses I still have.

I pulled up my pants, flushed my dignity away, and walked out of that bathroom a broken man.

Fast forward to yesterday. After mourning my lost earbuds for a week, I finally ordered a new pair. When they arrived, I was testing them out, telling my wife how they still didn't feel comfortable.

She looked at me with the casual confidence of someone who is absolutely certain of something and just said, ""You know you’re wearing them upside, right?""

No wonder they kept falling out.

52 years old and i'm still the same idiot I was 30 years ago.

So, to summarize:

Last week, I took a Crohn’s-fueled poop at work and managed to lose both earbuds to the toilet abyss.

I also stepped on my glasses in the process.

I just found out yesterday that I had been wearing my fancy Samsung earbuds wrong. No wonder they didn’t fit.

"TIFU and never helping anyone again

this happened a while ago, but to this day, I still cringe.

so, I’m on the tram, minding my own business, standing because, of course, there are no seats. then, out of the corner of my eye, I notice her. pretty girl. really pretty. she’s standing nearby, just chilling, when I spot it—something dripping from her nose. not just a little. it’s… substantial.

clear, shiny, and somehow reflecting light like a damn diamond. then I realize—it’s coming from both nostrils. at the same time. and listen, I’m a decent person. I carry tissues. two packs. one wet, one dry. I am that guy.

so, naturally, I do what any kind soul would do—I pull out a tissue and silently hand it to her. she looks at it. then at me. confused.

then she smiles, points at her nose with wide eyes, and asks, “this?” and I’m like, yeah, obviously, that’s why I’m—

… and that’s when it hits me.

I’m an idiot.

that wasn’t a rogue snot situation.

it was her piercing. a shiny, symmetrical nose chain that my dumb brain mistook for an absolute nasal emergency. I wanted to disappear. just evaporate into the air. she laughed. I muttered something about “having a good day” and got off at the next stop even though it wasn’t mine.

"TIFU by going to the house of a s*x worker.
I'm 28 male, until today I've had quite a few sexual encounters, but I never paid for it until yesterday.

Now I think people that sell their body are really in need of money or whatever reason they might have. But it felt a lot like taking advantage of someones vulnerability, maybe I think too much of it I don't know man. 

Anyways, I was usually happy just pushing horny thoughts to the back of my head when I have no girlfriend or a partner for intimacy, but yesterday I made the choice to seek out a sex worker because I was tired of wanking it.

So I got in contact with this woman, she said she doesn't go to homes and I need to go to her flat to do the deed. I left home excited for it honestly at this point it's not my brain that's controlling my body obviously. 

I arrived to the house, she opened the door and invited me in except her voice has nothing to do with the one I talked on the phone! As we walked towards the room I saw a dude sitting on the couch with phone in hand and he welcomed me said I'm finally here.

Dang at this point I'm weirded tf out, how do I not realize it's a dude talking on the phone. So I followed the woman to a tiny ass room, obviously they are living in quite poor conditions. But soon they got worse which I'll get into. We chat a little, get comfortable and stuff, I then asked for the bathroom.

Holy shit like I go in, I see a dirty toilet, worse is there is a bath tub and in it fucking shit. Literally, a fist full of human feces and it's pieces scattered around. I peed, went out, and I wanted to run the fuck out of there but I was also worried that they would cause me problem so I just made up a shitty excuse. I took my jacket, checked the pockets and acted like I was surprised, I told her I forgot my wallet, thankfully she just said ah then we can't do it. I said it's ok, maybe next time (never again) and went out. 

I don't think I ever walked that fast. I walked as fast as I could to my car and left the area immediately. 

I swear this was the first and last time I ever do this kind of stunt. I can't imagine what would I have caught had I stayed a little longer.","Went to pay for sex, regretted it after seeing a handful of shit in a bathtub.

"TIFU by trying to hold my breath underwater like a pro and passing out in the bath while my kid watched
My wife was working last weekend, so with two kids, it was a busy end of the week for me. Today, I finally had a moment of peace and decided to take a bath. My 2-year-old was napping, and my 8-year-old was busy playing Minecraft, so I thought, perfect, some alone time. Of course, alone time as a parent is a myth, and my oldest kept popping in and out to ask me random questions like, “Why are you having a bath?” or “Why are you lying in the bath?”

At some point, I got bored and decided to see how long I could hold my breath underwater. I usually manage around 100 seconds, and I used to be able to do over two minutes. I asked my son if he could time me because ""Dad is going to hold his breath for two minutes like he used to"". To be smart, I hyperventilated a bit beforehand, like freedivers do. I took some deep, rapid breaths to ""oxygenate"" myself, heard my son laughing at me, then went under. The next thing I knew, I was being yanked out of the water by my 8-year-old, coughing and gasping like a fish on land.

Turns out, I had passed out. My son later told me that around 90 seconds in, he started poking me because he didn’t want me to make it. When I didn’t respond, he realized something was wrong and actually dragged me up and out. After Googling what happened, I learned that hyperventilating before holding your breath is actually really dangerous because it tricks your body into not realizing it needs air. So instead of feeling the urge to breathe, I just… blacked out.

My son spent the rest of the day reenacting the scene for fun, while my wife (who thinks I’m an idiot for doing that) insisted I should visit the GP tomorrow to make sure there's no underlying reason I passed out. But honestly, I’m just lucky my kid was there. Otherwise, I might’ve become the dumbest Darwin Award nominee of the year.","Tried to hold my breath underwater in the bath like I used to, hyperventilated beforehand to ""boost"" my time, and blacked out. My 8-year-old, who was timing me, initially poked me to make sure I didn’t win, then realized I was actually unconscious and pulled me out. Spent the rest of the day getting roasted by my kid and my wife, who now insists I see a doctor.

"TIFU by not reading the quote.
Yesterday I dropped off the wife's car at the dealer for tires and oil change, est. was just a bit over $1500ish. I scheduled the visit but they overbooked it so they gave me a loaner and told me if they find anything, they'll let me know. 
This morning my wife forwards me an email from the dealership (her car, account, contact info), I glance at it while at work, saw recommendations for spark plugs but i didn't read it all the way. Looked at the total and it was again, just north of $1500. Tried to call them to find put how much but no answer. I figured, it was an electric copy of yesterday's quote becauseof the price, plus what they found.  I clicked approve because I'm already on day two and I do t want to hold it up amy longer.

I learned that it takes 6 hours to replace the spark plugs on a 2018 Lexus RX450h fsport, and the dealer charges $200ish per hour. Parts were $113 so just under $20 per plug. I'm quite handy so I looked up how to do it. It's a pain for sure, but for that much, I would've done it. 
It's my own damn fault for sure. I'm blessed that I can soak up a mistake like this. I'll feel it but it's not detrimental. I was going to spend that on getting my '09 work truck serviced, but I'll just have to do it myself now.",I approved a $1500 spark plug replacement quote because I didn't pay attention.,TIFU by not reading the quote.
"TIFU by being a stupid, selfish owner and not euthanizing my dog sooner
disclaimer: long post because i'm emotional.

my dog has had a long, steady decline for the past two years or so after being diagnosed with lower spine/hip arthritis. his mobility started to decline, and although it was sad to witness, he could still make it through day to day with the medicines i bought and administered to him. earlier this year in january, he was officially diagnosed with metastatic cancer with it spreading widely throughout his body, particularly to his lungs. the vet's prognosis was ""not good,"" and a quick google search told me that he only had 2 months left. the vet advised me that any interventions were not recommended, and to allow my dog to pass peacefully.

for the past few weeks, his health had decreased rapidly. his regular bathrooms started becoming irregular, where he would cry to be taken outside every 2 hours to pee or to let out massive diarrhea. now, he has a diaper and a mat under him at all times since he can no longer control his bladder nor is he able to poop easily without being in pain. he drinks a ton of water as if nothing quenches his thirst, and doesn't really eat anymore like he used to. his tail doesn't or can't wag, but he'll bring his head toward my hand, and sleep on it. he used to love running out the door and chasing squirrels, but he can no longer walk or move any of his limbs. he is immobile, in pain, and uncomfortable often, and demands a lot of care throughout the 24 hours of a day. my partner and i have lost a lot of sleep because of it, but i try to think that it was lucky that i get to wake up to my dog still breathing. sometimes, he sleeps so peacefully that i would wonder to myself if the rest of his days could be those peaceful moments, when he isn't crying out in distress or in pain.

last wednesday, when i tried to walk him for the last time, only to see just how limp he really was, i fully realized just how awful he must be living like this. he rested on me while i broke down because i felt so, so awful about letting him live for so long just existing but not living. existing in pain and in discomfort. i allowed that, and the guilt and shame of not realizing it sooner made me sit there and cry for a while as my dog just laid on me, unable to move anywhere else. that night, i made the appointment to schedule a vet to euthanize him at my house. the vet's office always scared him, so i thought the least i could do was make his passing as comfortable as possible. i scheduled it for 2 days from now, this upcoming wednesday.

today is his birthday. i planned to take him outside, for us to sit together in the sun and nice weather because he loved to be outside when he was younger. earlier today, i came home and found that he vomited. the vomit was smeared and brown, all over his face and arms, and i realized that he just vomited his own poop. i stood in shock for many moments because i could not believe just how awful that must have been for him. i hated myself for not doing the appointment sooner. i hated that i put him through all of this pain and suffering. and i hate myself for being such a useless owner. i contacted the vet, and requested the appointment to be moved sooner.

he was confirmed for tomorrow morning.

after he was cleaned up, the original plan still happened. we sat outside, took pictures, and enjoyed the nice weather until the sun set. i wished for more peaceful moments like this, but i was hugely relieved that it was going to be over soon for him. and sad. i have a mix of emotions that are hard to describe. but i enjoyed spending his last birthday and day with him just in the breeze while he soundly slept.","i should have let my dog go sooner. my love for him made him suffer much longer than he should have. he's a fighter; he's past his life expectancy because he wanted to stay. but i want him to rest, and i want him to have the peaceful passing he deserves. it's the least i can do for him—my good boy forever.

update (3/25/25): the weather is nice. he wasn't really able to sleep last night, but when i took him into my arms, he slept. we moved him to our backyard where he could rest on his pillow and blanket. the vet was very kind, gave us clay paw prints and clips of his fur. for the second medicine, it was rough because his veins were so fragile, so the vet had to administer it in the vein near his heart. he passed with his tongue out and deeply relaxed, which i was grateful for. we cut a piece of the blanket off and put it with him, since this blanket was one my partner and i made that our dog found a strong liking to. it became his blanket in a way; our blanket. every time i thought i could say goodbye, i had to come back one more time. i checked for his breathing like i usually did, and broke down when i realized it was no longer there. i sat on the side of the street for a while as the vet drove off with him. my partner and i moved to the backyard where he passed, and are reminiscing. the weather is nice.","my dog has been suffering from cancer for a long time, and i feel guilty for not euthanizing him sooner."

"TIFU going through TSA and testing positive for explosives after handling my late father's heirlooms
TIFU (September 2020) when headed to Denver, making my way through TSA at IND. I'm all dressed up and blinged out after being cooped up from COVID. I went through the body scanner and I lit up like a fire cracker on the 4th of July. (I thought it was because of all of my jewelry and accessories.) I'm taken over to the side. TSA took the palms of my hands and ran a metal tool over them, followed by a swab of cotten. I didn't know what kind of ""test"" they were running I just wanted to make my flight. 

Well... the test was positive, and the next thing I know, 5 or 6 agents swarm in and start taking my shoes and bags apart. I joked that they were doing this at the wrong time since I hadn't gone to Denver yet. They didn't find that funny. While they were looking at the sole of my boots I was wearing, I finally asked what they were looking for specifically. They said explosives and that I had tested positive! I started laughing in an unexpected way and began cursing my dear late father.  

My dad had suddenly and shockingly passed away a year prior (the day before Father's Day 2019). The weekend before I left for Denver, I was going through his things out in the garage and came across this fruit roll up looking thing with clay in it. A bit if it had been removed, and of course, I touched it. This wasn't an abnormal thing to find. My dad kept even his dad's stuff from the early 1900s, so i was always finding something. I put it to the side to look further into later. 

The night before I left on the trip, my ex visited my house to see the kids and noticed the clay fruit roll up. He made fun of me for keeping it like I had kept most everything else is of my dad's, which was one of the things we would fight about. In that moment I wanted to show him so I threw the clay thing in the trash. Before I left the next morning for IND, I took the trash out to the curb for trash pickup. 

It was about the same time when I'm standing in IND with a half dozen TSA agents around me going through my things that my trash was getting picked up. That was the moment when I realized what the clay was and the reason why I tested positive for explosives. I envisioned the trash man dumping my trash into the garbage truck and then... The mental image is still vivid after 5 years. 

Now you can understand why I just started laughing. My dad got me again with his stupid crap even in death. TSA was not amused with my explanation.","TIFU going through TSA and testing positive for explosives after handling my late father's heirlooms.

Obligatory this DID happen today.

Hi there, I’ve been a longtime lurker and commenter in this sub but never a poster. I’m in college in a Master’s program, and in one class all the teams had to make a presentation. My team was me and two other people. My teammates said the presentation was in good shape far earlier than they should have. It didn’t have even close to enough detail or polish. However, partially out of my own laziness and partially not wanting to disagree with the team, I didn’t push the issue  I did ask them if they thought this was good enough but they figured it would be fine.

It was not fine.

Everyone else’s presentation was about three times the size of ours, and had more flair and detail. It was embarrassing watching them. The professor went to speak with me after class and he was not happy with our work. Fortunately, he offered a chance for us to redo the presentation for some cr",,"My team presented a presentation that was way below par, and I didn’t push the issue. The professor was not happy with our presentation."
"TIFU by dumping 2 quarts of grease down my sink
ETA: We have a grease can. I know not to dump grease and fat down the sink and normally do not, but this time I very simply was not thinking. Regrettably I am human, and hopefully this means I've made my big mistake for the year already.

It was supposed to be an easy dinner for gym night. Pulled pork in the crockpot so the kids could serve themselves while we were gone and food would still be hot when we came home. I tossed the pork into the crockpot with some apple cider vinegar and onions and set it on high.

At about 4pm, 8 hours later, I check the crockpot. The cup of vinegar has turned into almost a full crockpot of liquid! Well, that won't do for pulled pork, so I put a strainer into the sink, dump the pork, let the juices run down the drain and plop the pork back in to finish off with some BBQ sauce. Dinner for my family is settled and ready!

Then the Mrs. Comes home, the conversation that follows is thus far my greatest shame in this relationship.

Her: ""Hey, when you drained the pork today, did you dump it into the trash or the sink?""

Me: *buffering wheel spinning* ""FUCK!""

I go down to find the sink full of standing water. So I go to work. Emptying the sink while boiling our biggest pasta pot of water. I have the sink mostly empty, dump a bunch of dawn down it, followed by the boiling water and..... nada. Now I have a sink full of hot soapy water. So I get the auger, maybe it just needs some help. Nothing. Can't even reach it.

So tomorrow, we fetch a plunger and I try once more before relenting and admitting to a stranger I'm an absolute moron.

At least the wife still loves me.","I was making pulled pork for dinner, and forgot pork had lots of fat. I drained that fat down the sink, creating a clog I can't fix.

Update: I fixed it. Left dawn dish soap in it overnight which cleared the standing water, and some grease cleaner and hot (not boiling this time) water seems to have solved it entirely... or moved it deeper into the plumbing. Who knows.",Don't dump grease and fat down the sink.
"TIFU by reaching into a pouch and creating my lifelong fear
Okay, so this didn't happen today, but it happened when I was 8 years old (23 now). 

For context, in my old house, we used to have this pouch hanging outside on our front door for quick and easy access for items such as pens and screw drivers. This pouch was higher than me so I always had to tip-toe and still barely reach in to grab whatever's in there.

Now comes the life changing mistake:

My grandmother visited from overseas, so as expected, she needed help with finding things. One of those things was asking me to borrow a pen. Knowing that we keep pens on the outside pouch, I proudly tip-toed and reached in blind.

I couldn't feel any pens, so I moved my hand side to side and felt something... squishy. I slowly slid my hand out while the mysterious thing rolled alongside my hand. As I finally removed my hand from the pouch, a huge beetle larvae fell to the ground, writhing. I was stunned for a few seconds as I gathered my thoughts and finally realized what it was. I screamed and tried to swat away the phantom feeling the grub left on my hand.

Fast forward to the present, I now have a huge fear of caterpillars, grubs, larvae and any kind that looks similar. Anytime I see one, I tense up, scream or just stop what I'm doing and look the other way. It's so bad to the point where I once threw away a perfectly good corn because I saw a really tiny caterpillar on it.

So yeah, now I guess I have to live with the permanent fear of those hell spawns. Don't get me started with moths or butterflies. They're just flying caterpillars.","I created a lifelong fear of caterpillars or any thing that looks similar, by blindly reaching into a pouch and pulling a beetle larvae out.","TIFU by reaching into a pouch and creating a lifelong fear of caterpillars, grubs and larvae."
"TIFU by eating an old ass double decker creme pie
So at the beginning of March I started working at this electrical wholesale company. It's a hybrid office/warehouse setting and their are two vending machines on the office side of the building. I bought a soda from the drink machine and it tasted kind of weird, when I mentioned it to one of the guys here he said, ""Ahh man I don't remember when the last time they restocked those machines was"". Friday of last week I bought a double decker creme pie and it was pretty decent taste. So this week I bought one on Monday and again it didn't taste bad, so today I bought another one. I noticed it was the last one in the line so I kind of just stared at it a little bit when I received it. I ended up eating it with a coffee I bring everyday from the house. When I took the first bite their was a peculiar taste but I just chalked it up to it mixing with the coffee and that's where that was coming from. It wasn't too bad so I eventually got over it and finished the whole thing. Welp, it's pretty safe to say that I now have the bubble guts. Which really sucks because theirs only 3 of us that work in this building and I keep having to go to the restroom and since I just started it looks really bad on my part to constantly get up and go to the restroom.",I ate an old ass double decker creme pie and now I am paying the price by having the runs.,I ate an old ass double decker creme pie and now I have bubble guts.

"TIFU by connecting with my daughter
So this happened yesterday.  We are having a family ski/snowboard day on the slopes.  Mom, Dad, Kid.  Kid is learning snowboarding.  They're rocking it.  But kid is also a pre-teen who has been distancing themselves from me.  It's ok.  It's normal to prefer one parent of the other throughout growing up.  Right now, it just isn't my turn.  Not gonna lie, it kinda sucks.

So to the TIFU.   Kid and I are going up the chairlift for the second time and this time we start talking.  Like a real back and forth, engaged, fun conversation.  I was riveted and we were making great eye contact.  You know?  The good kind of conversations where you really get into it.  Remember, though, that we are on a chair lift... we get to the top and neither one of us have noticed.  Suddenly there is ground below our feet, we haven't lifted the safety bar, and the ground we just saw below our feet starts to drop away.  Fuck.  I scramble to get my poles untangled and the kid lifts the gate -just- in time for use to slip off the seat at the edge of the ramp.  I get those damn poles stuck in the ground and they get tangled in the chair lift seat and now I have one frightened kid, one terrified parent, and two bent ski poles.  The other parent, you ask?  They're behind us watching the whole thing.  Good thing we didn't get hurt or make the lift stop to rescue us, but I don't this she is going to talk to me on a chair lift ever again.","had a riveting conversation with my kid and almost overshot the chair lift exit that resulted in one terrified kid, two damaged ski poles, and my last chance for a meaningful conversation with my pre-teen for the foreseeable future.",Talked to my daughter on a chair lift.
"TIFU by making my own username
Yeah uh tw for nazi dogwhistles
So first of all this obviously wasnt today, it was yeaaars ago, back when I was a kid and didn't know history and wasnt on very educational sides of the internet.
So, I was small and I was exploring the internet, watching youtube, living the best life. I came across many different websites and apps that I liked and joined. But the thing with most of those is that you need an account to do basically anything, and accounts require usernames. And in these usernames I liked to combine all of my favorite things in the world! That being wolves, mythical creatures (its where the winged part comes from) and then my favorite number. My favorite number has always been 8, still is actually. But after a while I started realizing something.. whats better than one 8? TWO EIGHTS!! Little did I know that this is a way for neonazis to signal off that they're a nazi. Now I made this username ""Wingedwolf88"" and set it as my username EVERYWHERE. I've successfully changed this username anywhere I could, but reddit and steam are a bit difficult. I don't want to delete my accounts, I like how old they are and looking back at my old me is so cute and fun. But I don't really want people thinking I'm a nazi..",summary: I was a kid and named myself with an 88 at the back of everything,I made my own username and now I want people to think I'm a nazi.
"TIFU by lighting a camp stove inside and almost causing a fire
It's a TIFU because I totally know better and the voice in my head said ""don't do this but it will probably maybe be fine.""

I received a warranty replacement of my camp stove because of a known defect that could cause it to become a fireball. I wanted to make sure the replacement worked before our upcoming trip so I fired it up in the house. Thankfully I had it on some spare planks because the new stove behaved differently than the old one and flared up.

Yeah, I was rushing to throw things in the bathtub to avoid causing an incident.

The stove flared up, the boards under it caught fire, and if I had not acted quickly I would have burned the house down.

"TIFU by getting Bali belly (which could’ve been avoided if we weren’t so stupid)
Mandatory this didn’t happen today (ETA “today”, forgot to add it before lol) been a few weeks at this point. I visited Bali (first international trip ever yayyy) and was sooo excited. I scoured the r/bali subreddit here for all advice and heard Bali belly a lot but coming from a third world country myself and being a doctor, I wasn’t too worried. I took all the meds one might need and thought I am good to go.

Well, the first few days were amazing. We ate at local warungs taking care of our hand hygiene and  noticing how hygienic the staff were etc and we were doing fine. The day before we had to shift base from Ubud to Sanur (2 hours away) for the last leg of our trip, we had an amazing batik class in rice paddies and were just roaming around when my travel buddy started feeling really tired. Then he started having cramps in his tummy. I was having a bit of loose motions since the morning but wasn’t too worried cuz I kinda sorta have IBS (not diagnosed properly but pretty sure I have it). Suddenly he goes _I feel dizzy please let’s just go back to the hostel_ And then proceeded to have diarrhoea and by midnight a fever of 102.8F. He spent the whole night having chills and worried we may have to go the emergency room if he had vomitting. By then I also had looser motions that definitely weren’t good old IBS I know so well and a slight fever. 

After a night of praying we don’t puke we went to a hospital on recommendation of the homestay owner we stayed at before the hostel and he was kind enough to take us there and it was expensive but thankfully we had insurance (hoping for the claim to come through or we are dead lol). I had antibiotics and all the meds needed for Bali belly but unfortunately fever just wouldn’t go down with paracetamol (tylenol) tablets so we had to get an IV infusion for my travel buddy. I puked twice on the way from the hospital in Ubud to Sanur. We couldn’t enjoy Tanah Lot or Sanur or do any water sports cuz of this. Barely made it to Uluwatu temple lol.

We were thinking that this is stupid why did we get sick more than a week into our trip and not before, what went wrong etc. Cuz we took all precautions including drinking bottled water only even at home stays and hotels. Then it hit us how we are the ones who fucked up and entirely responsible for our sickness. The day before we got sick, we had gone on a waterfall tour. We went to Pura Tirta Empul temple - this is a temple with a holy spring and a ‘purification ritual’. Being Hindu culturally (atheists religiously) we weren’t too passionate about temples but we love water and this was so interesting so we did it! You basically have to wash your head, face, hair and rinse your mouth thrice and then drink a gulp of water from holy spring water coming through a statue of stone. You have to repeat this procedure with around a dozen statues. So immersed were we buffoons in this fun ritual with cool water on a hot day and fish fluttering by our feet that we really did take the gulps of water. I mean we tried to take just a sip at each statue because it _is_ unfiltered water after all but what our brains didn’t process is that twelve sips is enough to give you viral or bacterial or protozoal load enough to cause diarrhoea lol. So yeah, basically, we were stupid enough to drink spring water and everyone we told afterwards in Bali including locals there were like _oh gosh you shouldn’t have, our tummies are used to the water but you guys!!!_ Yeah, we guys, being dumb tourists lol.",TIFU by drinking holy spring water in Bali and getting sick enough for my travel buddy to be hospitalised and ruining the latter part of our trip rotting in bed,"Got Bali belly, had diarrhoea and had a fever of 102.8F, puked twice on the way from Ubud to Sanur."
"TIFU by referring to my teddy bear
(Not today, but back when I was in college.)

I grew up in a family that had teddy bears that we treated as if part of the family, with similar names.... ""Tummy"", ""Tuffy"",.... mine was ""Tubby"". He's very cute and girls like him.  
  
My girlfriend at the time was going through a rough time and so was borrowing Tubby for comfort. 

One day after having lunch with her and her family, as they were all walking away I said something along the lines of ""Give my regards to Tubby!"".

I found out weeks later that her mom had though my use of ""Tubby"" was referring to her!  She was deeply offended. (Not completely my fault, but it would have been better to foresee the potential for misunderstanding, as her mom was indeed chubby.)

"TIFU by accidentally eating raw shrimp
My husband and I live overseas for the military. We went grocery shopping off base, and he picked out a bag of shrimp. I used them to make some rice paper spring rolls. The package wasn’t in English, and I didn’t bother to translate it. The shrimp were pink, so I assumed they were precooked. After eating the spring rolls, I felt nauseous and dry heaved a few times, but my husband felt fine. I took the packaging out of the trash to translate it and found out that the shrimp was raw. So not only did I accidentally eat raw shrimp, I also fed it to my husband.

"TIFU by buying a motorcycle sight unseen
This happened couple of weeks ago but the regret is not settling in. I was browsing my local version of FB marketplace and came across a rare gem of a motorcycle. It was a 1992 VFR 400R and the asking price pretty lower than what they usually go for in other countries. Me thinking I'll be smart and buy it then ride it for days, contacted my friend to setup the dealing since I was not in city. 

Now here is the kicker, the bike was in another part of the country so neither my friend or I could not physically check the bike, something you should ALWAYS do. Well now the bike is at my mechanic's shop and when i saw the photos as they took off the fairings, the dream turned into horror then regret then shame and now making peace by posting on reddit.

I have now decided since the mess up has been done, might as well go all the way and get all the parts needed to get it to restored condition and ride it till I find another too good to be true deal bike.","Bought a dream bike sight unseen, turns out needs more work than I thought.","Bought a VFR 400R in another country, dream turned into regret, decided to go all the way and get all the parts needed to get it to restored condition."
"TIFU by assuming someone was telling the truth about my behaviour and apologising profusely- only to realise months later that she’d lied to me
OKAY buckle up this one is pretty weird. I wasn’t really sure where to post but I see people putting things that didn’t happen as recently on this sub so maybe it’s a good spot.

I (21F at the time) had a friend named Mia (21F). We were relatively close and spoke over messages every day, but we lived very far apart and were going through covid lockdowns so we didn’t spend much time together in person. 

I moved out of my family home suddenly due to some drama and safety issues, and as such I was living in a pretty gross house with five roommates I didn’t know very well. Because they had already lived there a long time when I moved in it was obviously really difficult to try and change the cleanliness of the house. 

Mia liked baking so she offered to come over and help me make cookies and cake for my bf’s birthday party. We made plans and the next day she came over, helped with the baking, dropped me off at my bf’s house for a quick lunch and picked me up etc. She spent a couple hours in the house baking while I was at the lunch, then she picked me up and we continued baking together. 

Then she went home and never spoke to me again. I was heartbroken. I sought advice from lots of people and they all had different suggestions for why I might’ve upset Mia, but no matter what I did she wasn’t replying and eventually I had to give up and respect that she didn’t want to be my friend anymore. (For context, she had mental health issues so when she first stopped replying I did reach out to her sisters because I was worried)


So for months after that we were not in contact. I would often wonder about what went wrong and even bring it up to my friends, because I felt like I must’ve really done something horrible to upset her so badly and I wished I could know what it was. 

Then one day I see she is watching all my Tik Toks. These weren’t popular videos or anything, she wasn’t following me either, it seemed like she was genuinely searching up my page and stalking me regularly. I made a passive aggressive video directed at her. And then she messaged me.


In her messages she goes off at me for my behaviour during our friendship, told me I was selfish and never cared about her. She also stated that I left her alone in a filthy kitchen for hours forcing her to cook for my bf. At this stage, the falling out had happened so long ago, I didn’t remember the exact details of how we made our plans. I assumed that I had really been self absorbed, that I thought she didn’t mind me leaving for lunch and her staying behind, etc. I assumed that yes, I had been self absorbed and not considered her feelings at all. She told me I had treated her like a maid and a taxi driver that day. I apologised profusely and explained that the petty Tik Tok was immature, that all of this was clearly my fault etc and I would try to do better in future friendships. She didn’t seem keen on reconciling and I didn’t suggest it. We went back to not speaking after that night.


AND THEN- a few months later, I was reading through old text messages. Because I’m a very obsessive person I often go back and read conversations with people who I’ve drifted apart from. And in Mia and i’s conversation I found something shocking. 

The day before she comes over to help with the cupcakes, i mention needing to do it and she says she wants to help. It’ll be fun because we can hang out! I say that I would feel bad getting her to help so much, it’s going to be over 50 cookies and a large  intricate cake. I suggest maybe doing it by myself because she has an essay due. She says no I want to come help. Then I mention that because I have to go to lunch for my bf’s birthday, she might be alone in the house for awhile. I say that we could do our plans later or hang out a different day because I feel bad leaving her in the house cooking for me while I go out. She says no that’s fine I don’t care. I state that I’ll get a uber around midday then and come back around 2, and she says no I can just drive you it’s okay. 

So now- I can clearly see that she has lied to me. Or at least misrepresented the situation. The problem? I obviously  can’t confront her - because that would be pointless. We aren’t friends anymore and there’s no need to reach out just to make sure we’re on the exact same page about a fight we had. So I know I have to let it go.

But I can’t!!! Every-time I think about it I get so angry. I felt really horrible and ashamed when she went off at me, because I thought I had been a really shit friend. BUT I WASN’T!!!! 

So yeah anyways.","TIFU by assuming someone was telling the truth about my behaviour, and apologising because I felt bad. Turns out I didn’t even do anything.",My friend lied to me about not liking my Tik Toks and now I don’t know what to do.
"TIFU by telling my wife I would go monster in her hunter
I was enjoying some monster hunter after my son went to bed. Getting hyped up, and after a while I got pretty hyper. Like de-age myself 20-30 years hyper (been a while since I've seriously played a game). My last big game was on the 3DS, monster hunter GU for those who know. 

My wife comes home from work, so I pause the game to hang out. She's feeling good today, so suggests we do what married couples do. Me, still riding a high and feeling goofy, tell her I'm going to go monster in her hunter.

"TIFU by giving my (21M) 8 year older sister a haircut while my parent's went on vacation
Mandatory ""didn't happen today"" - it actually happened one year ago, today.

Last year, my (21M) parents wanted to take a trip around Europe for a week and I was left to babysit my 8 year old sister, ""Shayla"" and my 17 year sister ""Lisa"". My older sister (33F) was with us for the first 2 days, and then I was alone with Shayla & Lisa for the next 6 days.

I was like a ""bad parent"" cause I really just let Shayla do whatever she wanted and we went wild. I took her to an amusement park, let her stay up way past her bed time, skip one day of school, eat too many snacks. It wasn't anything detrimental, I just brought her rebellious side out.

Then, Lisa cut her hair at home and got those ""fringe"" hairstyles (idk haircut terminology). It looked really cool, and Shayla was obsessed with it and wanted to do it too. I thought ""f\*ck it"", so I let Lisa cut Shayla's her and give her a fringe. It went SOUTH and halfway through, Lisa handed me the scissors saying she's messing it up.

Again, I thought ""f\*ck it"", I've cut hair in lockdown and decided to finish the haircut. I messed it up more. At the time, Lisa and I were laughing because it was starting to look really bad. We were horrible, horrible siblings for that and I completely acknowledge it. At one point, Lisa was laughing hysterically cause I made an Edna joke, and Shayla got off the chair to look in the mirror.

I thought she'd be upset, but didn't realise how badly this would affect her. Tears started trickling down her face and with her voice breaking, she said under her breath, ""I look so ugly."" Her saying that was one of those glass shattering moments for me. I instantly realised how big of a f\*ck I did. Up until then, I didn't even consider how this would ruin her confidence. I didn't even know that kids had self-esteem, if that makes any sense. It's such a basic thing, everyone has it, but I didn't even care to think about hers. I hugged her, tried consoling her, but she was crying a lot.

I tried thinking on my feet and I told her I actually had a surprise for her. This was a prank, and I'd booked an appointment at an expensive hairdressers who'd give her the best haircut ever. Under her vast amount of tears, there was some curiosity, and after a couple minutes, she started smiling gleefully thinking this was all supposed to happen. She put on a cap, and we got on the train to go towards the central part of the city. On the way, I searched for the hairdressers with the highest ratings and accepted walk ins.

I told the hairdresser what happened on the side, and to fix her hair somehow. About 2 hours later, her haircut was done and the hairdresser did an incredible job. She did all kinds of things, gave her a fringe, and slightly dyed the tips, idek what the rest of the stuff was, but it looked amazing. Shayla was really happy and I got her ice cream, then took her home. The haircut cost me half my savings too, but it was worth it and I was really grateful to the hairdresser. That night I cried a lot in the shower because I felt like the worst person in the world.

That day taught me a very valuable lesson and I'm never in my life going to play around with a kid's confidence for shits and giggles. I did an insensitive, stupid thing and I still feel a pit in my stomach when I replay her saying ""I look so ugly."" Never again.","cut my little sister's hair when my parents went away, but it turned out horrible.",I gave my (21M) 8 year older sister a haircut while my parent's went on vacation.
"TIFU by not preparing for a tattoo
I had a very large tattoo planned for today, and I thought maybe I could do it all in one session. Usually for a tattoo you should eat and drink plenty before going, as it's quite hard on the body. Also it's best to have plenty of sleep before.

I didn't do that. After a late night at a party, I woke up on 4 hours of sleep and could get back to bed. Because I'm on a diet, I only had a light breakfast and made my way to the tattoo parlor. SO I started the day pretty low on energy.

Sitting waiting for the artist to set up, I realized that I was feeling quite tired, but only in a sleepy way rather than an exhausted way, so I figured I'd be fine just lying on my side for a few hours while the tattoo got done.

A few hours later, having not finished the entire piece, I left the parlor in pretty good shape. Wandered around the city waiting to catch my train back home, visited a pharmacy, grabbed a coffee. But as I waited in the train station an hour later, I started to feel light headed, and rested against a wall for a few minutes. As the time to go the platform approached I got up, started walking and promptly fainted. I woke up in a pool of blood with my head dashed against the tiles of the station, surrounded by onlookers and a few helpful people.

They called the ambulance, I went to the nearest emergency room, and after 13 stitches in my eyebrows I'm left with a hell of a scar and a headache. I'm lucky I didn't get a concussion. I got home about 5 hours after finishing my tattoo, with pain in places I expected and some I didn't. Now I need to get the stitches taken out, and I'll complete the tattoo in few weeks.",": fainted after a tattoo because I was low on food and sleep, ended up in ER.","Didn't prepare for a tattoo, woke up in a pool of blood with 13 stitches in my eyebrows."

"TIFU by trying to cut on combustibles when smoking weed
I'll preface this by specifying that I am Canadian, so this TIFU isn't about anything willfully illegal.

3 months ago I have decided that while I like weed, I could do it without burning so much paper down by lungs. I tried vapes but they weren't my thing, good vaporizers are bulky, and as I don't smoke indoor they are not a good fit for me. Same thing with bongs.

So I went to my local headshop and asked them for an alternative to burning papers. I know about pipes, but I don't trust heated up aluminium and I didn't really want anything with potheads motifs on it. Eventually he got a box from under the counter and suggested a nice alternative to pipes: A glass tube, about the size of a large pen, and with a space with a glass separator with a hole on one end to fill with herbs. He assured me that the hole wouldn't let grossly cut herbs pass, and suggested to push a bit a steel wool down as a filter the tube if it became a problem. That thing had a classy look to it, unbranded, handheld and useable with one hand, so I bought it thinking it was ideal. I even went to the grocery next door to get steel wool pads to go along with it, what a nice suggestion that was.

So I've been using that glass pipe for the last 3 months, going on the back porch every other evenings to smoke a bit. Unlike a rolled up joint, I can control my intake by refilling the pipe, I don't inhale paper, it's easy to clean with some agent orange, with a torch lighter it's quick and easy to use, I love it!

Fast forward to today, when my neighbour struck a conversation with me. After a few minutes of talking he asked point blank if I was ok, if my girlfriend took to my ""new habit"" well, even asked if I needed help. He looked very concerned and I didn't undestand why at all, everything is actually fine and I couldn't phantom what he saw to think otherwise. Then he told me ""I know you enjoy weed, and I'm no stranger to it, but escalating to crack will kill you and your relationships"". I was so confused, I assured him that I never touched anything like that, that my 3-4 joints a week were enough and maybe even too much, but hard or illegal drugs were not my thing. 

He then told me that it was useless to deny it, he and his wife could see me regurlarly using my crack pipe from their kitchen window, that it's been going on for a few months, and he'd prefer if I didn't that inside if I had to do it.

And the it hit me... I've been Googling crack paraphernalia for the last 3 hours, ashamed of myself, angry at the headshop guy who knew exactly what he sold me (suggesting steel wool?! Wow!) and of me using this in front of people.

"TIFU by accidentally terrifying my fiancée twice in one night.
This happened around six months ago. My fiancée (29F) and I (28M) had just signed a contract for a new apartment. We had been dreaming of moving to a bigger place for a very long time, so this was a huge deal for us. Apartment search process leading up to this had been extremely stressful for me, as getting an apartment in our city is infamously hard. 

When we came home that night, we decided to celebrate with a couple of alcoholic drinks. Around 10pm I noticed that I had a scratchy throat, and I knew I could not afford to be sick during our move in a couple days. Due to stress and exhaustion, I completely failed to mentally connect the dots that I had just had alcohol, and took Ibuprofen. 

We went to bed late and I fell asleep almost immediately. I had a dream that something very unpleasant was happening to me. I don’t remember what it was specifically, but it felt disturbing. The feeling of nausea very slowly pushed me out of deep sleep, and at some point I became awake and aware that it wasn’t only in my dream. I felt like I was going to throw up. Still drowsy I sat up on the bed. Slowly I started to become aware of what was happening to me. Alcohol and Ibuprofen both have blood thinning effects. And when I am generally very stressed, I get nosebleeds for some weird reason. Put all of these factors togethers, and get this > I got a strong nosebleed in my sleep. Because I was sleeping on by back, the blood had been flowing to the back of my throat, and as a reflex in my sleep, I had been swallowing it for hell knows for how long. 

For context, I have a weird relationship with blood. Talking about it, seeing it on the screen or even in real life has no effect on me, most of the time. But reading about it or thinking about it under very specific circumstances can knock me out surprisingly quickly. 

So I am sitting there on the bed, realizing that I’d been chugging my own blood. The thought alone has sent my consciousness into another freaking dimension. 

My fiancée (I will call her H), was awake during all of that, sitting on her side of the bed, engrossed in something on her iPad. She saw me sat up, but thought I was going to the bathroom or something and didn’t pay attention to me. However, she heard me plunge head-first to the floor. The freaking miracle was that 1) before falling asleep I tossed my big back pillow onto the floor next to my bed, because it was uncomfortable to sleep with, and this is where my head landed, and 2) I fell at an angle barely missing the windowsill with my forehead. H rushed to my side and saw me lying on the floor, unconscious, bleeding all over the place.

I used to have epilepsy, and I fainted on H once in the past terrifying the living hell out of her, because according to her I stopped breathing and she thought I was dead. So in that moment she was reliving her nightmare, thinking I was dying / dead, especially with all the blood. 

I slowly came to, became aware of my position, of her shaking and frantic talking to the emergency line, and I knew what had just happened. She was saying things like „he is not breathing, please hurry“ etc. I was like „H, calm down, I am alive lol. It’s nothing bad“.

I slowly sat up and explained the reason behind my fainting. It wasn’t epilepsy. It’s the usual blood fainting thing. Nothing dangerous. I will be fine, I just need to stop my nosebleed. She didn’t seem to take in the words I was saying, and I understand why. She was extremely scared, and I did my best to reassure her I was fine. 

A few minutes later three paramedics came into our small studio apartment, let in by H. They started asking a lot of questions, including if he had taken any drugs. We hadn’t and we told them so. They focused on H and kept asking her again and again if *she* had taken anything. For context, H is legally blind. She has extremely low vision and nystagmus that causes her eyes to move involuntarily. This is a question she gets asked a lot. But in this case it was more than frustrating to her, because she wanted them to pay attention to me.

I explained everything. They were like „Got it! Get dressed“. They insisted on taking me back to the hospital, to run all the necessary checks, just in case. I dressed and went with them. They told H to stay home, go to sleep and that I would come back in the morning. It was around 1am. 

They strapped me into a seat in the back of an ambulance and started driving. They asked me to tell them the story in detail, again. I was eager to do so, because I knew they’d see it wasn’t an epileptic seizure or anything bad. I started telling them why happened, vividly. I guess I started reliving the situation, because I fainted right in front of them in that seat. I came to, to find them shaking me and calling my name. I must have looked like a maniac, because the first thing I did was smile happily, pointing at myself and yelling „just like this! I fainted because of the blood, just like I did now! Do you believe me now?“.

They did lol. But they still wanted to run a few tests. 

Flash forward, all tests went fast, and all the results came back quickly. Everything was fine. They sent me home at around 3am. I caught the night tram and went home. H didn’t know I was coming back so early, and I didn’t think I should call her, because I knew she’d be asleep. And she was.

I tried to open the door as quietly as possible not to wake her up. But that was a mistake. When I came in and turned a small lamp on, I saw her mid-jump in the bed, grabbing for her phone, the look of utter terror distorting her face. 

She told me later that it was one of the worst nightmare situations for a woman to live through. She said imagine you are a woman, sleeping alone in an apartment, and being woken up by the sound of someone trying to unlock the front door, in the middle of the night, when you are not expecting anyone. She thought she was going to be murdered, and in her desperation tried to find her phone to call the police. 

It took maybe 10 minutes for her heart to stop pounding. I apologized profusely for making a bad call to not tell her I was coming back earlier. Looking back, I should have predicted exactly what would happen. 

Safe to say, not my best night.","TIFU by terrifying my fiancée twice in one night. First, I took Ibuprofen after drinking, which led to a nosebleed while I slept. I unknowingly swallowed a lot of blood, fainted from the shock, and scared my fiancée into calling emergency services, thinking I was dying.

After getting cleared, I returned home at 3 AM without warning her—only to accidentally scare her again when she woke up to someone unlocking the door, thinking she was about to be murdered.",TIFU by accidentally terrifying my fiancée twice in one night.
"TIFU by Recommending a Song to a Grieving Woman
This happened yesterday actually. At work I was ringing up an older lady and I said that I was surprised that the 24-oz. can of beer she bought was only $0.99. She said that she had just lost her father and that she felt like she had to take a walk which led her to the store to buy beer. I expressed my sincere condolences. I then said that what she told me reminded me of the song “Drink a Beer” by Luke Bryan which is about losing a loved one and that she may want to give it a listen: “I took a walk to clear my head and this is where the walking led, can’t believe you’re really gone.” I further explained that in the song the walk leads the narrator to sit outside and drink beer like he used to with the person he lost. The lady said that I may make her cry because her father liked to sit outside and drink beer and began crying as she left the store.",I recommended a song to a grieving woman that I thought may help her and instead I made her cry more about her loss because the song reminded her of her dad.,I recommend a song to a grieving woman that reminds me of the song “Drink a Beer”
"TIFU by skipping class because the AC was broken
Today was an unusually hot day, and things were going fine until I received word that the AC was broken in a classroom I was supposed to have class in. The thing is, I had been in that exact room for an earlier class and everything was fine, but I wasn’t expecting the heat to be as bad in the room as it turned out to be.

I was with some friends as I walked in, I took one step and said “HELL NO” as soon as the heat hit me. Normally I would weather it out like I’ve done a few times before, but today just wasn’t it for me. My body was already overheated and I needed a cooldown, so I told my friend to just tell the professor I was sick.

My fuck up? The professor was already in the room when I did my little in-and-out. He saw it all, and according to my friends I spoke with after class, he was not very pleased with me and made a point of it to everyone. And when I say everyone I mean everyone, because had I not dipped, that would’ve been the first time the whole semester that the whole class was present for a lecture. Fuck my life.

Here I am now, with an unexcused absence on my record for the first time. I feel like this was the worst possible class for me to get an unexcused absence for due to two reasons. 1: I’m pretty sure I fucked up badly on the midterm so my grade is definitely not standing too well already. Another unexcused absence would drop me a full letter grade, and I don’t need a fail on my record for the first time in my life. And 2: This professor really doesn’t like people not showing up or being late without notice. Me doing that probably looks extremely disrespectful in his eyes. So that’s a cross I’ll have to bear until I see him again…after a whole fucking week.","Skipped class because the room was too hot, but the teacher saw it and was pissed off.

"TIFU by shitting my pants
On a date meeting my girlfriend of 8 months parents for the first time. Right after I finished dinner, I went to the bathroom to wash my hands. While I was there, I felt a fart coming and decided to let it rip. It was not a fart. Spent the next 20 minutes attempting to wash the stain off my underwear while giving my girlfriend a half-assed excuse on how I had to leave. Drove home commando with my shit-filled underwear in the trunk while was bawling my eyes off. Three days have passed, and her and her family are still upset at me for leaving on such short notice. I still don’t know if I should come clean or double down on my excuse and never speak on it again. I don’t know who else to tell this to who wouldn’t clown me forever for it so now I’m posting here.

"TIFU by forgetting to lock up my store for the second time
So, I work at a very local store, normally closing with someone else, but twice a week I close by myself. Last year I had an incident when I forgot to lock the store after I closed, but thankfully nothing happened and it was my boss who found out in the morning and I got a talk but that was it. I apologized and promised it wouldn't happen again. I have since been checking everything I close by pulling the door to make sure it was locked. But yesterday I somehow forgot again, today someone came in thinking it was open and the alarm went off, police arrived and now my boss has to pay a fee. I just feel so bad and confused, I could've sworn I locked it yesterday, like I can't be that fucking dumb to repeat the same mistake again. But apparently I am. I don't know what to say or do. My boss send a text to all workers saying that because someone didn't lock the door last night none of us would be allowed to close by ourselves until they came back (my boss is on vacation right now).

"TIFU by opening my sex tape montage at work
My new phone has a feature enabled by default that collects any series of photos or video taken at a specific time or location and creates a slideshow from them.. So a few weeks ago, I was trying to impress my date by taking her up to see the amazing views from one of the condo showrooms where I work, a fancy downtown apartment building, where we ended up having sex.. I, consensually ofc, video recorded us in the act and took a few x-rated photos of us in various sex positions. She's a cam girl, so she didn't object. Until then, the only slideshows I'd get were pictures of my cat, scenery, or food I ate at restaurants.

Flash forward to a couple of weeks after the encounter. I'm at work, waiting for the elevator. Two of them were down for maintenance, so the wait times were increasingly long, and soon enough, a crowd started forming. I took my phone out to pass the time, when suddenly I got a ""new story"" notification. I tapped it open it, and to my horror the pictures I took that night began shuffling on my screen. The worst part is the background music alerted the people behind me before I quickly hit the shutter. I walked away incredibly embarrassed and heard giggles from the two girls standing behind me.. I think I should quit, change my name, grow a beard, and go off-grid for a while because I don't know who else saw. This is without a doubt the most humiliating experience of my life.","my amateur porn randomly played at work, and people saw.",TIFU by opening my sex tape montage at work.
"TIFU forgetting to put water in the egg pot
Meal prepping for the week.  I’m on a diet and struggling to stay full, get my macro numbers, and not go over calorie budget. I fell in love with “salsa eggs” for breakfast. (Think egg salad but in stead mix the egg with salsa and top with a dollop of sour cream.). I set the eggs in the pot and was going to go back to cook them when my meds kicked in.  Evidently I had a complete brain fart and turned on the stove… but forgot to add the water.  An indeterminate amount of time later I smell cooking, walk by the stove and remember I have eggs on… and realize they have no water.  Now I need to make 9 more eggs, but I am no millionaire! 😬 

Can’t post a pic but, horrible, just think horrible.

"TIFU by convincing myself that someone I’d never met before likes me.
I’m not gonna share too many details, but just know that I’m still in school. Around October last year, I noticed this girl in choir (I go to a Catholic School and we have Mass on Fridays) and caught her looking at me. I didn’t think much of it until it kept happening. This girl isn’t from my grade, mind you, but rather a few grades below mine. 

I guess I have the right to have been weirded out. My biggest issue is the extent I went with it. I think that a part of me was intrigued by the idea of catching someone look at me, though i couldn’t tell you why. It’s not normal for me to have a “secret admirer.” That’s something I hear a lot of people talk about, and I haven’t really experienced it much.

Anyways, I kept having these times where she would look at me, and for some reason my reaction was to start conjuring up a story in my mind that had no way of being proven. I would tell myself that she’s practically stalking me, and even though I knew it wasn’t true I kept going. My biggest fault was sharing this with my friends. Not only did they tease me about it because of the grade difference, but they started entertaining thoughts that she has romantic interest in me. The situation kept going and I kept bringing her up and eventually it got to the point where I believed that she had some sort of interest in me. 

I let these thoughts run through my head for several weeks, but around mid February, I went on a retreat to a campsite dedicated to the Sacrament of Confirmation. This gave me a lot of time to think and reflect and I thought about her. I think I finally realized that I really screwed up. I’d let all of this information flow out of my mouth to the point even though I had never have a genuine interaction with this person. I didn’t understand that I overreacted and was over thinking so hard, and now I just feel like crap. It’s like I want to apologize to her for telling people these things that probably aren’t true, but it wouldn’t make sense because we don’t know each other. 

This is just something that’s been stuck on my mind and I feel like absolute crap. No one deserves to get rumored about like that, and what makes it worse is that I have significant status in my school. All that happened was she looked at me a few times and that was enough to get me theorizing. For all I know, there are people talking about how this girl is a starer. I just wish I could say sorry. I feel like a total creep and jerk.",I spent months convincing myself someone significantly less mature than me has a crazy intense interest in me.

"TIFU with a brand new circular saw
44 yo dude, not super handy but not hopeless either.  Trying to attach 2x4’s to drywall for a project so I went to Lowe’s and got a jigsaw.  

Well turns out $30 jigsaws aren’t that good at cutting 2x4’s, the blade was super hot and the wood was smoking while barely moving so I went today and got a $70 circular saw.

"TIFU by reaching out to an old friend
This isn't very dramatic, but it really is hurting me. I (57f) had met someone who I'll call Brad (currently 58M) through a dating ad in an alternative weekly newspaper back in 1993 or so. We met at a diner where he was in walking distance, but as it was cold, I drove him home. Before he left the car, while my hand was on the stickshift, he put his hand over mine and said pointedly, ""I'd like to see you again."" So, there was at least some interest on his part.

We ended up hitting it off, but not having a romantic relationship. I would have been open to it, but I was overweight and shy and never would have made the first move. I think there were moments in our friendship where he might have been interested, but the timing wasn't right. But overall I was more interested in him romantically than he was in me. We did have a couple of cuddling sessions, all initiated by him, so there was at least a small bit of chemistry.

We were, however, very good friends. After my mom passed away, we took a road trip from where we lived to Las Vegas, Nevada. This was a 1700 mile, 24 hour driving trip where we drove straight through switching drivers. We stayed in Vegas for several days, with a short overnight up to Bryce Canyon in Utah where we camped out (this was the site of one of the cuddling sessions). I stayed there while he continued his road trip and I flew home later.

A few years later, when my dad was getting remarried, Brad traveled with me to the wedding, which meant dealing with a bunch of my family that he had never met, and all of the awkwardness that goes with that.

At one point, I found myself pregnant with a guy who was less than supportive. I asked Brad if he would help me with birthing classes and that sort of thing, which he agreed to. I ended up terminating that pregnancy, so it never happened, but he was willing to be there.

A few years later when I got married, Brad stood up in my wedding (my betrothed was very shy and introverted and simply didn't have a big friend pool to pick from). 

All of this is to say that I feel like we were pretty good friends. I know that Brad always wanted to be married to someone, and wanted a family of his own. There was definitely a distance between us after I got married, and I think part of it was that he always thought he'd be the one to marry before I did. Anyway, after I had a baby, we moved across the country for my husbands job and I lost track of Brad altogether. When I found out I had breast cancer, I messaged him to let him know, but never heard anything from him. We went on with our lives and ended up moving back to the same town after nine years.

Fast forward to now and I'm about to get divorced. I'm much more outgoing than my fiance-nay, so I've been trying to meet new people. I thought it would be great to reconnect with Brad. So I looked up his info and emailed him a few days ago. 

To my delight, he texted back and we caught up a little -- he told me that he was going through some turbulence because on the one hand his brother is not doing well physically, but on the other hand, he is interested in a woman he knows. We chatted back and forth and I told him that I'd love to get together with  him to catch up. He said no, because he didn't have ""the bandwidth"" to handle that at the moment. But we texted over the course of nearly three hours, exchanging photos, etc. I showed him some of my artwork and he asked if he could make one image his screen saver. Hours after ending our conversation, he texted me to tell me about a musician he thought was really cool, so it seemed like he was wanted to at least have casual conversation, if not actually meeting up right now.

An hour later I texted him that I found out a friend had died -- someone that Brad had at least met. No response. A couple evenings later I texted him with an inside joke of ours -- a funny phrase that his name anagrams to. So, totally lighthearted.

The next morning I get this text: ""I'm sorry, but I don't think you're hearing me. I don't have any deeply personal context for how to respond to you now. I like you but we are not close. The good old days were in fact not good for me and all my work and growth since is under current threat and requires my full attention.""

I haven't responded since. I'm floored because I feel that even though we haven't talked in a long time, we certainly were close 30 years ago. I mean, we traveled together and he stood up in my wedding. I want to respond  with this, but I'm concerned that he will shut off all communication with me and I don't want that. If he gets together with the woman he's interested in, that's fine. But since moving back here ten years ago I've wanted to reconnect. I'm hurt by what he said.

"TIFU By Needing Space and Probably Lost a Good Friend because of it
Obligatory ‘this was a month ago not today’

So I (M) had a friend who I’ll call Charlie (M). We met around August last year and we hit it off sraight away. From day one we got on, supported and understood each other. As an example, I struggle to socialise with people (mild Autism/Aspergers) and despite how easily he and I were together, he saw that I struggled without me having to tell him. 

Fast forward a few months and our friendship startwd to become something more for me and I found myself wanting an actual relationship with him. Unfurtintaley, he has a SO (F). 

Now fast forward to about 3 weeks ago. He had recently moved, and I had said I would help him if he needed it. So, I went round and we finished setting up his bedroom (assembling desk and rearranging the furniture). We had some food and a few Rum and Cokes and were just talking around all sorts. 

I felt very comfortable with him, and knew I could tell him how I felt without there being immidiate consequnce (its something that I don’t feel often due to people reacting poorly to it). I told him there was something I wanted to tell him and asked if he’d stand up so I could hug him which he was fien with both. We stood there for 5-10 minutes whilst I told him that I was happy with us being friends but I did want more. He was ok with it (not his first time in this situation). All he asked was that I respect him, his SO and his relationship, which I was fine doing because it’s both what he deserves and it keeps someone important to me in my life. 

He did ask me if I wanted some space to deal with how I was feeling and at the time I felt like I could handle things and that him not being there would do more harm than good. 

Over the next few days we still spoke to each other over teams chat at work which was fine for me. 

Then we were in the office together. I was relying on the normalsy of our friendship to help me through how I was feeling. But he wasn’t feeling 100% so we had to cancel plans after work as well as standing lunch plans on the same day. Thos hit me like a truck. I was sat on the train home and was resisting bursting into tears with how I was feeling.

That was sort of a break point for me to admit that I needed physical space to deal with my feeling and where I fucked up. 

I text him telling him I needed to talk because I didn’t want to make decisions about our actual friendship withou him. But for work I spoke with our senior manager so that we wouldn’t be in the office tofether for a few weeks, just so I could get my shit together. I told him the next day about the work stuff.

Following the weekend I messgaed him to ask how his time off was and he ignored me, which was unusual. I messaged him asking to call me as my gut was telling me something might be wrong. He messaged me back to say we only had a professional relationship now. 

This sent me into an emotional spiral. I called him multiple times and text him to no response to find out what was going on. When be did respond he said that he wants to stay professional at work but because my feeling affected his work life, he didn’t think I wouldn’t impact his relationship as well and that our friendship was over.

"TIFU by forgetting my AirPods were connected during an important Zoom meeting


So this happened earlier today, and I still want to crawl into a hole.

I work remotely, and we had a big Zoom meeting with several higher-ups in attendance. I was just listening in, so I muted myself and decided to grab a quick snack from the kitchen. My AirPods were in, and I was still connected to the meeting while I rummaged through my cabinets.

Now, my dog has this habit of sneaking into the kitchen whenever I open a bag of chips. So as soon as I ripped open a bag, I whispered, “You sneaky little bastard, I see you.”

Except… I wasn’t whispering to myself. I was still connected to the meeting.

I didn’t realize anything was wrong until I heard dead silence, followed by my manager saying, “Uh… who are you talking to?”

At this point, I froze. I checked my screen, and sure enough, the little green microphone icon was ON. I panicked and blurted out, “Oh, uh… my dog.”

Cue awkward laughter from a few people, but I could tell some of the higher-ups were NOT amused. One of them dryly said, “Let’s try to keep the side conversations to a minimum.”

The worst part? The meeting was being RECORDED for future reference. So now, my little outburst is officially immortalized in company history.","– Forgot my AirPods were connected, called my dog a sneaky bastard during an important Zoom meeting, and now it’s recorded forever.",TIFU by forgetting my AirPods were connected to a meeting.

So this happened yesterday, around 2:00am. I just ubered home and was blackout drunk. I live with my sister, and we have seperate bathrooms. Mine is downstairs and hers is across her room and just down the hall from my room. My drunk ass thought it would be a good idea to use hers because I was too lazy to go downstairs when I already layed down in my bed. I waddled over to the bathroom and without even turning on the light pissed all over the place trying to aim for the toilet that I couldn't see. I ended up ruining some her makeup products and soaking up her bathroom mat with pee. In the morning she woke up to a disgusting stale pee smell all over the bathroom. She woke me up and dragged me to the bathroom to show me what I did. I was so hungover and confused I just stood flabbergasted and embarrassed.

"TIFU by taking a funny picture of my best friend
For context, me and her (Japanese) are college friends. We are studying masters rn. We are the closest friends for each other in college (so I was pretty comfortable with her and she too). One day when we were going in a bus, she told me she gonna sleep for a while. I thought it'd be funny to take a picture of her face by keeping the camera close to her chin. I did and chuckled and sent it to her with laughing emoji. But after seeing that, she got so much angry and told me she doesn't like these kind of stuffs. I asked her apology and deleted the photo I took. From that day, she doesn't talk to me. She kinda ignores me. I'm genuinely terrified because now I lost my only best friend in college. I wrote a letter to her asking sorry and explaining my situation in Japanese ( I translated from English but remember that japanese kanji words are very hard to write for a beginner) She saw the letter and texted me she read it. But she didn't say anything after that. I don't know how to make everything normal again :/",I took a funny picture of my best friend and now she started hating me,TIFU by taking a picture of my best friend's face.

"TIFU by not realizing a customer had bags
So looking back on it, this was actually really stupid that I was worried about this but I was just kinda stressed I guess. 

Some relevant information: I work aat a grocery store, I'm 15 so this is my first job and I started it in January, I have been sick for about the past two weeks and I live in a pretty small town which is why this situation really stressed me out.

It all started when I was up at the till and I wasn't supposed to leave because everyone else was busbusy putting out all the freight that had just gotten there but I hadn't had any customers in a while and my ear piercing was kind of itchy so I took out my earring to properly scratch it but before I had a chance to put it back in a customer approached so I figured I would just set my earring down on the cash register while I rang the customer through and when I was done I'd put the earring back in.

Well, as I finished ringing her through and bagging her items since I was the only person at the till, yet another customer approached and it kept on going on like that for about five customers until eventually I got to this old lady who had only 3-4 small items (this part is important) and there was no other customers in sight so I figured I'd quickly ring her through and get my earring back in. Well, in my distracted and sleepy state I neglected to realize that she had brought bags with her so the moment that I was done ringing her through I turned my back to her to grab my earring and swiftly put it back in.

 After that I quickly turned back to see her placing her own items in her bag and I instantly recognized my mistake. Now obviously, apart from the fact that I just should've bagged her groceries because it is part of my job and I obviously made a mistake here, there is nothing that old people hate more than bagging their own groceries but before I could even apologize or think of what to say she said ""aren't you supposed to be doing this!!"" And I wasn't really sure what to say but I was just like ""oh yeah I should've I'm sorry"" because what else do I say I messed up and I can learn from that but I'm not gonna like, take all her groceries out of the bag so I could re-bag them and she was like ""well, you won't have a job for much longer"" and walked away and I know this was probably dumb of me but I got really scared that she like actually had the connections to get me fired or something but like I know I messed up but I feel like I don't deserve to get fired over it? Like I felt really bad for not bagging her groceries but I think everyone makes mistakes sometimes? I won't lie at the time I did start crying a bit because like I've had one or two rude customers but normally they're not mad because I actually did anything wrong so this was kinda different.",I didn't realize that an old lady had wanted me to bag her 3 or 4 items because I was distracted and she told me she would get me fired.,TIFU by not realizing a customer had bags in her bag.
"TIFU by pulling an elastic battle rope too hard and almost blinding myself
So this happened today, and my face still hurts.

I was at the gym, feeling good, ready to get in a solid workout. I decided to switch things up and use those elastic battle ropes—you know, like the normal heavy ropes, but stretchy. I figured they’d give me a killer resistance workout while making me look like a beast. Spoiler: I did not look like a beast.

I started off with some standard waves, but then my dumbass thought, Hey, what happens if I pull harder? So I did. I yanked the rope back with full force, stretching it to what I can only assume was its absolute limit. And then, physics happened.

The rope snapped back at the speed of light and whipped me directly in the face. I swear, I saw my ancestors for a second. The impact landed less than a centimeter from my eye—right on my cheekbone. If it had been just a little higher, I might be writing this with one eye.

I stumbled back, clutching my face, half expecting to see blood. Thankfully, it was just an angry red mark and some swelling. But the best part? There were at least five people who saw the whole thing. A couple of them gasped, one guy actually laughed out loud, and the gym staff just stared at me like, This idiot really almost took himself out with a rubber rope.

Now I’m sitting at home, icing my face, reflecting on my life choices. Moral of the story: Elastic battle ropes fight back.","Pulled an elastic battle rope too hard, got slapped in the face at Mach 10, almost lost an eye, and got publicly humiliated in the gym.",I pulled an elastic battle rope too hard and almost blinded myself.
"TIFU by accidentally sending hentai to my mom

 I meant to call her on WhatsApp, but my stupid ass fingers somehow tapped the stickers tab instead. Out of all the possible stickers I could’ve sent, I managed to send one of an anime girl sucking a massive dick. My soul left my body. I deleted it instantly, praying she didn’t see it. But she came online way faster than expected. Did she see it? Was she just about to type something? Panic set in. 

Five minutes later, I called her to ask what was for dinner. She sounded totally normal—no hesitation, no awkwardness. Maybe I was safe. Or maybe she saw it and decided to pretend it never happened. Either way, I am never opening WhatsApp stickers near my mom again.

"TIFU by masturbating to porn behind my boyfriend's back.
Title says it all. I feel horrible about it and literally started crying minutes after doing this. The only reason I'm talking about it online is so I can talk about it somewhere and get this shit off my chest. I (17f) and my boyfriend, I'll call him Josue (18m), have been together since early freshmen year, so around 2 and 1/2 years. We were each other's first everything, first kiss, first true love, first sexual experiences with another person, everything.

Tonight, I got a wild hair up my ass to get on the hub and look up guys soloing. It's been on my mind recently for some obscure reason, and I hope to God I got whatever the fuck this is out of my system. Even though I already looked up stuff like this before we started talking, which only makes this worse, I for some reason got the urge to do it tonight after all this time. I don't know if it has anything to do with being each other's firsts and not having explored with other people before committing and if it's just some deep down desire to do so, or what. Either way, I have no excuse for what I did and I feel like an absolute pig.

I love him an incredible amount, I do want to marry him more than anything and he is truly the most amazing person I have ever met. I genuinely love him with all my heart and I never want to lose him. I'm also very sexually attracted to him, so I don't see why I've been focused on this.

"TIFU by taking Adderall instead of Prozac
Without getting too into it, I've had a history of mental health problems since childhood. I tried a number of different medications as a teenager, but ended up disliking the side effects and stopping use altogether by the time I was 18. Now, at 23, I've been in therapy for a few years and decided with the help of my therapist to try it again. This is where the problems start. 

A few months back I see a sort of shady zoom psychiatrist. She diagnoses me with ADHD within a 20 minute conversation, with no diagnostic test, and prescribes me Adderall. I've previously suspected I've had ADHD, so I went with it. I tried taking it for a while, but have a lot of anxiety/ocd issues that it exacerbated, so I stopped. I didn't throw it away or anything, just threw it in my  cupboard and forgot about it. The capsules were green and white. 

A few weeks later, I decide to give meds another go, but with a different psychiatrist. This one seems a lot more like an actual doctor. Decides on starting me on prozac for my OCD symptoms. I pick the meds up from my pharmacy. They're also green and white capsules, just slightly smaller. 

I get a weekly pill organizer to keep track of my meds, and on week 2, I grab my meds from my cupboard and load it for the week. 

I'm not noticing anything too different on prozac, but it isnt supposed to kick in for 3-6 weeks so I'm not that worried. Sometimes I forget to take it until later in the day, like 7pm. I'm having my normal anxiety symptoms, but sometimes struggling to sleep far beyond my usual insomnia. I'm not hungry, my mouth is weirdly dry, and my hands shake on occasion but I attribute it to not eating. 

Today, I go to load my medication into my pill organizer for the 3rd week, and I notice they look different. I read the label, but it says prozac. It's definitely the right pills. Suddenly I remember the Adderall also in my cupboard. Upon investigation, I've been taking Adderall for at least the past week. 

Now I have to restart weening myself onto prozac, I have no idea if it's helpful or not, and I've been unknowingly on Adderall for hopefully 1 week maybe 2? All because I couldn't keep track of my pill bottles. Plus at my month out appointment I'll have to explain I've actually only been taking it for 2 weeks!

"TIFU by oversleeping for Kart Race
I (20M) have a family member that is big into kart racing and races local rental kart leagues that are surprisingly competitive.

We planned that he would pick me up at 9:45 AM to go to the race.

TIFU by ordering a Funko Pop online

I was browsing online when I came across what looked like a rare Funko Pop for an insanely good price. The listing had low-quality photos, but I figured I was just lucky to find a deal. Without thinking twice, I hit “buy” and waited excitedly for it to arrive.

Today, the package finally showed up, and the moment I opened it, I knew I had made a huge mistake. The paint job is absolutely horrific—like someone tried to color it in while blindfolded. The eyes are slightly misaligned, giving it an unsettling, deranged expression. The worst part? The box doesn’t even say ""Star Wars."" It says ""Star Wart."" I had officially been scammed.

I immediately checked the seller’s page, and—of course—after scrolling down a little, I found multiple reviews from people warning that they only sell bootlegs. At this point, I don’t know if I should be more embarrassed that I fell for it or that I didn’t even check before purchasing.

Now, I’m stuck with this horrifying Funko Pop staring at me from my shelf. I don’t even want to display it, but throwing it away feels like admitting total defeat.

"TIFUpdate: being girlfriend-less (even though I'm not anymore)
[OG post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/s/DWVI7QXkKN)

The mods removed my first update.

Last night my roommate had company. Lots of company. The apartment was full of people when my gf and I returned from our date night. As soon as my roommate noticed my gf and I zigzagging through the crowd to get to my room, he blocked the way and offered us weed. My gf and I said no thank you, but my roommate insisted. Based on the euphoric expression on my roommate's face and his theatrical body language, I could tell he was drunk or high or both. I convinced my gf to wait for me in my room so I could have a word with my roommate. Cue my gf entering my room and closing the door behind her. I pulled my roommate aside and asked him what the fuck was happening. My roommate automatically apologised for all the bodies in our apartment and promised that everyone would be gone by 10 o'clock. I made him aware that it was almost midnight. 

My roommate swung his arm around my shoulders and asked if I was planning to make midnight love to my gf. I said that was none of his business, but yeah. My roommate hugged me without warning and whispered the word ""understood"" before raising his voice and unexpectedly announcing to the living room filled with random strangers that it was time for everyone to go ""be Gen Z"" somewhere else because I needed peace and privacy to fuck my gf. For no reason whatsoever, my roommate decided it was necessary to explain to whoever was paying attention that my gf was, in fact, a girl, and not a guy, because I was not gay, despite my parents believing that I most definitely was gay because of a butt plug my younger self failed to prove belonged to someone else. I interrupted my roommate and awkwardly encouraged everyone listening to literally ignore everything that just came out of my roommate's mouth, except for the part about leaving.

All of a sudden I heard a random voice saying ""we must pray"" before everyone closed their eyes and bowed their heads. I looked at my roommate who looked back at me like he was telepathically saying ""just go with it bro."" Someone promptly paused the music at that moment. It was only then when I noticed the playlist being displayed on the TV was titled ""Christian Crunk."" The person that said ""we must pray"" proceeded to pray. It was a guy wearing a shirt with the words ""More Lord"" on it. More Lord used the power of prayer to encourage his ""fellow brother in Christ"", aka my roommate, to continue leaving his door open for many more nights of praise and worship. When he was done praying for my roommate, he moved on to me, which I added to the fucking plethora of WTF moments happening at that point.

More Lord didn't know my name, so he went with ""my young brother who plans to fornicate tonight."" He prayed for me to get blessed with enough wisdom to at least practice ""safe premarital sex"" before asking his omnipotent dad to heal my relationship with my parents and to provide me with all the answers to the questions I might have about my sexuality, so that I would never feel ashamed about exploring the bottomless treasure chest of things that pleasured our bodies. By the time More Lord was done praying, it was passed midnight. More Lord hugged me afterwards. His fellow brothers and sisters in Christ did the same. When all of them were gone, I looked at my roommate like what the fuck. 

To sum up the unnecessarily long story I had to hear, my roommate invited a group of Christians to our apartment because he was attracted to one of the girls in the group. A girl who was only attracted to religious guys according to him. But since he was not religious, he thought he might as well pretend to be in the most elaborate way possible. Hence the Christian cult in our apartment. I walked away without commenting because I wanted to save my energy to, you know, ""fornicate."" However, when I entered my room, my gf was passed out. I followed her lead and called it a night. What happened last night was hands down the most bizarre and uncomfortable experience I've ever had with random people I've never interacted with before. I thought they were gonna Midsommar my ass. 

TL:DR Roommate invited a Christian cult to our apartment without informing me. I made the mistake of confronting my intoxicated roommate and confirming that I was planning to sleep with my gf, which he turned into a public announcement that prompted the Christians to pray for my soul and subsequently preventing me from having sex because my gf, who was waiting for me in my room, ended up falling asleep.",,Roommate thought I was going to make midnight love to my gf because I was not gay despite my parents believing that I most definitely was.
"TIFU by shopping on Amazon
So I have an Amazon account, and a family. 

Anyhow, the person I'm seeing likes to do things with me... try new things if you know what I mean 😏 

Recently I've ordered a few packages with adult toys, swing, etc. And... clone a willy. It came in yesterday while I was out. While I was out I got a notification that the cloning kit came in. I sent my son a text asking him to bring my Amazon package in. He said he had already. I didn't think much of it. 

Until last night when I went to go... use it. I asked my son where the package was on my way out the door. He asked ""The plant stand or the cloning kit?"". Mind you, the boxes DO NOT say what the contents are, nor were they opened. 

He must have realized what he said because my face is a goddam story book. I just stood there silent and shocked. He pointed towards the closet. This has been going on for ages, but he has NEVER indicated knowing what's in the packages.

"TIFU by interrupting a funeral procession.
So I’m driving to my grandma’s house with my sister in the car. She lives in the area I grew up in and it is and always has been sketchy as fuck. Bad part of town.

We pull up to a red light and see a dude next to a motorcycle standing in the middle of the intersection. Being from the hood, our sketch radars are going off. These are the type of people you try to avoid. 

I also notice a weird amount of people turning left on the green light. More traffic there than I’ve ever seen. 

But anyway, my light turns green. Yet all these people keep turning left. My sister and I are like what the fuck and we decide to just go when we have a chance because these people are all acting insane. 

But as I pull into the intersection, someone continues trying to turn left and honks at me. Then motorcycle guy comes up to my window, bangs on it, and screams, “uh uh! Back it up!” 

Shaken, I just back up which is difficult because all the cars behind me have started moving too. That’s when I saw the tiniest little text on his bike saying “motorcycle escort” and see the first car in this entire line with its hazards on. That’s when I remembered there was a cemetery a few blocks up.

We get out of the situation, finally, and I ask my sister if she was able to tell it was a funeral procession. She agreed with me that she could not tell at all. I only saw one car with its hazards on and not a single one had those little flags funeral processions do sometimes. The motorcycle escort was not clearly marked.

"TIFU by not wearing my knee brace to work.
i (21tm) work at a private preschool and am mainly in the 2 year old room. i started there about four months ago with no prior experience in childcare (other than watching my little siblings as a kid), and i really love it. but today wasn't ideal.

about a month ago i partially dislocated my knee. not being a full dislocation, i never had to relocate it. it just shifted out and back in. very painful nonetheless. i did it climbing down from a step ladder, and no, i didn't even fall. i just didn't pivot my left leg enough as i was stepping down and my center of gravity sort of caused it to pop out. i was home alone, and i screamed for about 45-60 seconds straight (in my defense i've never had a dislocation, sprain, or fracture in my life). i grabbed my mom's old knee brace and put it on. i was back on my feet that evening, although i did use crutches at the very end of the night because the pressure was starting to aggravate it.

went to the doc the next day. no ligament damage, and x-rays came back normal. i was advised to continue wearing my knee brace and given a packet of rehab exercises. 

i did wear it for about a week and a half, and within that duration of time i dislocated it again walking to my bedroom after a bath (this time my poor family was home, and everyone was practically falling over themselves trying to reach me when i screamed). 

after that 2ish weeks my knee felt pretty normal. a little weak here and there, but no pain and no dislocations. i should've continued wearing my brace anyway, but to be quite honest i had a bit of imposter syndrome. the medical evidence revealed no notable damage, and it's not like it was a *full* dislocation. i worried i was being dramatic, or at the very least, i feared other people would think so. so i took it off. 

the next 3 or so weeks went by without incident. i was back at work chasing toddlers as usual, a very physical job as you can imagine. every passing day i became more convinced that my knee was fine. 

a then today happened. 

it was after nap time in the 2 year old room, and i was folding up blankets and putting the cots away while the other teacher in the room was doing potties and diapers - our usual routine. and then it happened. i was simply walking when i felt the shift and my knee gave out from under me. the scream came out of my mouth before i could even process what had happened, but once i was conscious of it i immediately suppressed it to a groan and i sat up. i tried to play it off, i took deep breaths and assured everyone that i was okay. but the damage was done. the children were so frightened, and one even started crying. 

i called the office to have another teacher sent to switch out with me, and i grabbed an ice pack and drove home. i cried a bit if im being honest. 

i let my imposter syndrome, and my projection of judgement unto others, lead me to making an incredibly irresponsible and stupid choice, and as a result i ruined about a dozen toddlers' days. i feel terrible, and ashamed. the worst part is i actually played through this scenario in my head a few weeks ago. ""what if i dislocated my knee in the classroom?"" but i wrote it off, thinking that would never happen. i wish i hadn't.","i didn't follow my doctor's advice, and as a result i dislocated my knee in front of 13 toddlers and traumatized them with my wailing.",i partially dislocated my knee a month ago and now i'm not wearing my knee brace to work.

"TIFU By not updating my ID
17M, I have dreadlocks, had them for one year now. Around 3 months ago I cut 6 of them off in the top of my head so I can have it split middle and it wouldn’t keep hitting my face. It was the first time I cut my own hair and in my mind since my hair grows extremely quick i though it wouldn’t be an issue. While my mom got me extensions it was the wrong color and dirty, they all fell out quickly and while I was there my mom said “tell them what you did” and I explained the above. 

Everyone laughed and an old lady sitting in front of me snickered after making eye contact with me and the guy was trying to hide his laugh while using me as an example for how he does extensions, Ive been too ashamed to go back. As expected hair grew quickly enough for me to get a retwist.

Now for my ID, It’s last been updated when I was 15 so when I tried calling an UBER to the spot it suddenly forced me to show it. I NEVER HAD TO USE AN ID BEFORE, normally I would go from my house to my school since I’m a hermit but In my mind i assumed it was because the usual distance, keep in mind its $40, 19 miles away and im panicking that I’m running out of time and didn’t want my mom to get a late fee since I’m paying for the uber but shes paying for the hair.

My grandmother has a disability so she told me she couldn’t make the distance and tried helping me with the uber, after no luck of my ID nor Face ID working i rescheduled for Tuesday. My grandmother then mentioned that my ID i had a small afro and I currently have long dreadlocks so it messed with the scanner, I didnt notice at all.","Update your ID’s y’all because I couldn’t get an Uber since my face and ID didn’t fully match, i needed to fix my hair because I cut it wrong and I embarrassed myself.","Had dreadlocks for one year, cut 6 of them off in the top of my head so I can have it split middle and it wouldn’t keep hitting my face."
"TIFU by vomiting everywhere
So yesterday, my friends and I got together to play Wii and drink. We were playing Beerio, but honestly, we were just drinking whenever we felt like it, and I was not feeling it. This was only my second time ever drinking, and the mixture of tea and alcohol in my mouth was simply deplorable. I was significantly more sober than everyone else at this point, and trust, this did not go unchecked. They were all telling me to drink more, so I asked if I should just take some shots to hopefully catch up. I ended up pouring my own, and looking back, I was definitely heavy-handed. But I don’t really know what a normal amount looks like, and the glass I had wasn’t a shot glass. But for the moment, all was good! I had so much fun giggling and rolling around on the ground. 

At some point, we all went upstairs and started talking to my friend’s mom. She handed us some wine, which I indulged in an uncertain amount of. I think it was at this point that I was no longer locked in, I was locked out. It hit me like a bus, and I really do not want to think about how I was acting in front of her mom. Or her brother, who was also there for some reason. I remember walking away mid-conversation to go to the bathroom. And I think I actually went, but I also blew chunks. Everywhere. So awesome. I was told that I basically crawled into the toilet, my pants were off, and the vomit was on the door, on the side of the toilet, on the wall, and on the floor. To be honest, I’m impressed I managed to get it everywhere but in the toilet, which is funny, because it was right there. Super cool. I think my friends brother also saw me 😇🔫

I don’t remember much after that. I would just regain consciousness in a different room. I know two of my friends were helping me out a lot. I have flashes of them wearing these bright-ass orange gloves, which was kind of scary, I felt like I was at the evil doctor’s office. Especially when they put me in the shower like a livestock animal. They cleaned up after me, which I’m extremely grateful for. I just feel really guilty because that was definitely an unpleasant experience for them, and I don’t even know one of the people who helped me very well. I offered to buy dinner when I was driving the friend I do know back home, but she declined and said it was fine.

Should I just send a thank you text, or is that too OD? I want someone to take me out back and put me down like a dog.",Got together with friends to drink and play Wii. I got too drunk and threw up all over the bathroom. They spent the night taking care of me and cleaning up. I feel super guilty.,TIFU by vomiting everywhere.
"TIFU by not checking my pockets for weeks and finding...
>!...a mouse. A dead mouse.!<

I have never even imagined this is something that can actually happen and I still can't fathom how it came to be, exactly.

So 3 weeks ago I went to a carnival. I wore cargo pants (I went as a postman, original I know). The night ended at my buddy's where we crashed for the night. 

The day after, my gf did the laundry (including the cargo pants I had worn the day before, which were in my backpack) and told me my backpack smelled kinda funny. So that went into the laundry as well.

Fast forward to a week ago, we went to the hardware store. When we were about to leave, I had a rotting stench in my nose. Just for like a second. I tried to locate the smell but couldn't find anything so I didn't think much of it.

I meant to buy only screws, but of course we ended up with a plethora of stuff so I lost track of my original mission.

On our way back, I realized the screws were missing so I checked all my pockets, not being sure whether or not I had bought them.

I checked all my pockets, multiple times. My gf insisted on checking my pockets as well, multiple times. All there was was an apparently laundered and dried tissue in one of the lower pockets of my cargo pants. We didn't take it out, because why would we. Hah.

That was a week ago. Today I found my pants crumpled up under the bed so I wanted to put it into the laundry. When I picked it up, a stench went into my nose. Kinda smelled like a rotting corpse. I put my nose up to my pants and it smelled fucking abysmally disgusting.

I figured there had to be something in there I didn't want to find. Idk what I was thinking not going in there with gloves or something.

At this point I was still in denial, thinking maybe it's from soldering fumes.

I felt the tissue in my pocket, so I took it out to throw it away before it going into the laundry again. 

At first glance, it was oddly dark for a tissue. Then in a split second, before my brain had even processed the information I jerked whatever this thing was through the room.

It was the source of the stench that had haunted me for weeks. 

It was a fucking...dead...crumpled up...laundered multiple times...rotten corpse of a fucking mouse.


Our only theory is that when I crashed the night at my buddy's, his cat brought a mouse and put it in my pocket. This still sounds extremely unlikely but it's the most plausible theory we could've come up with.

I'm open to theories, though. Maybe this is something that just happens? Anyone ever found a dead mouse in their pockets? Interested in founding a support group?",Checked my pockets after weeks. Found a rotting mouse.,"Went to a carnival, found a dead mouse in my pockets."
"TIFU by telling my fiance he was built like a woman
My (27f) fiance (26m) and I were having a discussion about sexuality. We enjoy having lengthy conversations about various deep topics. This was not something that wasn't ever discussed before. I am bisexual and he is straight. He is very confident in himself and isn't someone who would ever be offended by being perceived as gay. He has some traditionally feminine features, like gorgeous long hair, and beautiful long eyelashes. He is attentive and a good listener. He is thoughtful and caring. He helps me pick out my outfits, my nail colour, and do my hair. While he is still a masculine dude, he has a soft aura about him, especially with me. I have joked before that he was written by a woman. 

While talking about my past experience, I was telling him that while I still find women attractive, I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything. I said he's the best of both worlds. What I intended to say next was that he was ""built different"" and ""written by a woman"". Instead I told him ""I don't miss women, because you are built like a woman"". Thankfully he knew what I was trying to say and thought that this was hilarious, but I know that he will never let me live this down.","tried to say my fiance is built different, and was written by a woman.

"TIFU by making fun of my dad’s past relationships and finding out my mom’s a cheater
My dad(41M) recently got a girlfriend, and it seems like it’s going well. He has been in too many relationships for me to even count. With girlfriends, with boyfriends, so many people. I was on a call with him today, thought about him and decided it would be nice, and I made a joke that essentially pointed out just that. It was something to the effect of “what is this, your twentieth?”

The thing is, my dad is a serial gossiper. Despite me being his son, he will tell me all about his current relationships, all the time. But I will emphasize current relationships, because apparently I didn’t know about the shit ton of relationships that ended badly for him.

He started talking about why he’s blown through so many partners. Ignoring red flags, them cheating, stuff like that. Then he suddenly explained that when I was really young he had a boyfriend he stuck with for a while. They seemed perfect for each other, but then the boyfriend suddenly died in a car accident.

At that point he started getting really emotional, still going through all of his relationships in a random order. When he got to my mom, who I love a lot, he said she actually cheated on him with some dude he was in a band with in his teens and it made him feel like chopped liver.

I had NO IDEA this apparently happened, and I’m pretty sensitive about cheating since my boyfriend of 4 years cheated on me. So I made him pause here, and made him explain further. After we ended our call, I called my mom. I chatted normally for a bit before I finally brought up that my dad told me she cheated on him.

She said it was true, but he made a promise to not tell me so she was very pissed about that. She explained the reason was because my dad was pretty awful to her after he found out she was pregnant, and she couldn’t build the confidence to break up with him because somehow he’d always find ways of avoiding the topic. Plus this was the father of her child, it put more pressure on them to stay together.

She said she knew it was wrong, but this was about 20 years ago, and she wouldn’t be so hesitant to break up with a guy now. 

Anyways I just sat here absorbing my parent’s intense relationship drama and likely made the two mad at each other. I feel very drained and it’s still morning. *I also don’t know if me disregarding the fact my mom cheated is me being a hypocrite when I usually despite cheating.*",", my dad told me about his past relationships, got very emotional over the death of one of his boyfriends, and then told me my mom cheated on him*, which my mom confirmed.",I made fun of my dad’s past relationships and found out my mom is a cheater.

"TIFU by spending the night with my ex after I told him I wanted to remain friends
To preface, I put this as NSFW because I’m talking about a hook up, but I don’t actually describe any details regarding it. ALSO everything was consensual in the moment, I’m just regretting it now. 

Anyways, about a month ago I (F18) met this guy (M19) on Hinge. We were getting to know each other and through that we found out we had the same mutual friend, and were both invited to their wedding. We decided to carpool, since I don’t make much so it would save me some gas money, and I liked him romantically at the time. 

Through the weeks we spent more time together and I realized I liked him better as a friend, so I broke things off with him. We still decided to carpool, since we were remaining friends and I still wanted to hangout with him. Now, the wedding was yesterday. When he picked me up, he kept trying to hold my hand and touch my thigh, to which I kept disengaging and brushed it off. I should’ve called him out but I didn’t, I’m quite introverted so calling people out in the moment is not my specialty. We talked a bit during the car ride, but I was feeling a bit relieved when we made it to the church. The wedding itself went good, but the guy was giving me weird vibes all together. It’s been a month since I’ve met him so it’s not like he was a stranger, but for some reason it felt like he wanted it to seem like we were a couple when I made it clear we were just going as friends.  

Now, after the wedding I’ll admit I was tired, a bit touch starved and altogether wasn’t thinking correctly, so when he asked if I wanted to spend the night, it sounded like a good idea. I don’t know why I thought that was a good idea but I digress. Now, you can probably put two and two together to figure out how that went. In the moment I was okay with that but this morning I made an excuse as to why I needed to leave, and I haven’t answered any of his texts. He’s asking if we can be something serious again and I just can’t. I don’t like him like that and thinking back to last night it’s very clear that I was horny and liked the attention in the moment. 

I’m feeling like such a douchebag for leading him on like this. He’s a great guy, very kind and respectful, I just don’t like him romantically. I just wish I thought about the aftermath a little more before agreeing to do anything with him.","messed around with my ex after a wedding, now he’s wanting something serious while I don’t.",Spent the night with my ex after I told him I wanted to remain friends.

"TIFU by being a terrible date
This wasn't today but several years ago. When I went to college, I was involved in greek life and there was a girl in a sorority that I had a crush on. Beautiful, fun, smart, good sense of humor, all of it. The first time I remember meeting her, I had gotten invited to come down to her sorority house and hang out after they had a party. She opened the door with a big smile and grabbed my hat off my head, put it on her own head, and then took off back into the house. I was hooked. Spent the night talking to her a bit and playing drinking games with everyone, but she was intoxicated so I didn't try anything with her, and she didn't really remember us interacting that much. 

Well, I ended up asking her to be my date to a formal event that was coming up and she said yes. Unfortunately, I am a bit of a silent person. Not even intentionally, I just don't talk all that much unless I have something to say or if I have known you for a long time. Socializing isn't really my thing. So, I unfortunately did not talk to this girl hardly at all for the whole night. By the end of the event, I could tell she was less than impressed with me. I tried to salvage it at the after party and be more social with her, but she ended up going home by herself and declining my offer to drive her home. ""It's fine, I'll walk.""

She ended up texting me a couple weeks later asking why I had even asked her to be a date if I wasn't going to talk to her and didn't even ask her to stay the night, clearly I wasn't interested in her. We ended up texting a bit and it turns out she thought that I did not like her at all based on my behavior that night and had just asked her because I had no other date for the event. I don't think I could have fumbled that date any worse.

When I opened a can of store-bought tomato sauce it sprayed out like a shaken soda can. I didn’t even think about it being an issue since it has never happened before.  I took a couple of bites of my pasta. It tasted fine.

So yeah, title says it all. Today, I got my phone stolen, and I’m absolutely kicking myself over it.

I’m a 20M, and I had just returned from my hometown to attend my university in Bangalore. The very next day, I need to collect my exam hall ticket—which, of course, was on my phone. To make things worse, all my net banking apps and UPI were on it too. They’re all PIN-protected, but still, the thought of losing control over everything is terrifying.

I tried everything:

* **Find My Device?** No luck.
* **Calling my phone?** Phone is switched off.
* **Blocking the SIM?** Done immediately.
* **Remote wipe?** Attempted.
* **Securing accounts?** Changed passwords for everything important.

And honestly? I just feel stupid and angry at myself. I know these things happen, but that doesn’t make it any easier.

Man, I can’t believe this happened yesterday, and I’m still absolutely dying inside.

So, our house is under construction right now, and because of all the work going on, we’ve been using this side room that has a common bathroom. Since the main entrance is blocked, everyone’s been using it.

Anyway, I had no clue anyone was in there. I just casually walked in to use the bathroom like any other time, and boom — I walk in on our maid in the shower. She didn’t lock the door. We both just froze. She looked at me. I looked at her. Complete deer-in-the-headlights moment.

This happened yesterday and I returned home just fine, mom didn’t really care and was interested in the tattoo. My dad’s across the country right now.

I can’t tell if he’s being serious. Talked to him just now about my tattoo and further appointments because I had more lined up in the coming weeks. He said his main reason why he didn’t want me getting tattoos is because I’d have trouble finding a job. Which is a reasonable concern for him to have, but we’re in an age where employers don’t care about that anymore. He said there’s nothing we can do since I’ve already got the tattoo. Just that I’ll have to move out once I graduate. This is also a sort of “ultimatum” that I don’t understand coming from him because that was the general rule in our house anyway: you graduate, get a job, and move out. 

I’ve cancelled my other appointments already so I don’t piss him off any more. I don’t graduate for another 2-3 years so it’s not like I have to think about this soon. Just don’t really know where to go from here.","I got a tattoo, dad said I’ll have to move out upon graduating, but I was already supposed to move out so I’m confused on why that’s the ultimatum

Note: I did not try to sneak around him and get the tattoo while he was away, otherwise I would’ve done that when he initially left rather than just a month before he returns. I also simply wouldn’t have done it if he told me tattoos weren’t allowed. I just didn’t tell him because a tattoo on my skin doesn’t and shouldn’t require his approval given what he told me about his influence on my choices after turning 18. Or I guess I was wrong about that, but he didn’t tell me tattoos weren’t part of that freedom of choice :/",Dad told me I have to move out when I graduate university.
"TIFUpdate Gave my youngest son advice on happy relationships and my oldest son's girlfriend to dumped him
I've had a few requests for an update, but life and it's troubles kept happening each new day since my original post. I made some comments on the original post but there were just too many to answer everyone and deal with the PM's people sent me. I'll try to answer the many and varied questions in this update.

I'd like to clarify that my oldest son is a young adult, and no longer lives in my home. He came over long enough to drop off my youngest son's gift, eat some cake, and left with his girlfriend. My daughter and youngest son are still teenagers. My daughter and my oldest son's girlfriend met through my son, but they are still friends even after the break up.  

With that said, on with the update; After my oldest son and his girlfriend broke up, and he yelled at me for it, many things have been said, some things I didn't know were revealed, and some secrets were told.

I gave my son a couple days to cool off before I spoke with him. My wife tried calling a few times, but  he wouldn't answer his phone, so I went over to his apartment. His roommate convinced him to let me in to talk. And we did. We also did some shouting, a bit of yelling, and hugged once as well. This is when I found out that my son got a job offer out of state a few weeks ago. It's part of an apprenticeship through his trade school. He is considering it and this was one of the reasons for the recent tension between him and his girlfriend. She wanted him to stay here, where her family is, and he wanted her to go with him if he took the apprenticeship. It's almost twice the hourly rate he makes at his current job, and the apprenticeship will pay for some of his time spent in classes, although the cost of living is higher there as well.

Some people pointed out that my son is a bit misogynistic, and I initially thought that may be a bit true, and I learned part of that is from some of the examples he has seen in my home. I talked to him about this and discovered that he sees things about my marriage in a way they were never meant to be seen.  
  
One thing that my son pointed out to me was this thing my wife and I call my ""magic coffee cup"". You see, when my wife is home, I am not allowed to make my own coffee. My wife has always made my coffee since we first started dating. This isn't something I have ever demanded, it's just the way things have always been. It became a joke between my wife and I when we were dating that my coffee cup must be magic because I've never had to fill it myself. Now, after many years of marriage, it's become something I don't even think about.   
  
My wife will pick my empty cup up and say some silly magic words like Hocus Pocus, or Bibbity Bobbity Boo while waving her hands over it, and then she takes it to the kitchen and makes me a fresh cup. Sometimes I will pick up my empty cup and say some magic words and then shake the cup or peak inside and then in a pitiful whiny voice say to my wife ""Honey, my magic cup isn't working again."" The few times I have tried to make my own coffee when she is home, she gets up, hip checks me out of the way, and makes it for me. I learned my lesson long ago, but my kids never saw that play out when it first developed.  
  
This is not the misogynistic act my oldest son believes it to be. I do not think it is my wife's place to have to slave for me by making my coffee. She does it because she loves doing it, not because she has to. If she told me today that I had to make my coffee from now on, I won't say a peep. I'll kiss my wife and go make my coffee.   
  
This has become part of another running joke that we have going. The joke is we each don't let the other do specific things around the house so that the other ""forgets how to do them so we can never leave each other"". Officially, I do all the laundry, and she does all the dishes (In reality she does wash the occasional load and I do the dishes every once in a while, but we never admit to doing so). I learned to cook her favorite foods so she ""forgot"" how to make them, and she does the same for mine. For example, she can't make 'eggs over easy' anymore, and I've forgotten how to make a good 'slop' (which is sausage and egg noodles in cream of mushroom and topped with fried onions, terrible for you but SO GOOD) 

This, and other little quirks, is part of our love language, and it has taken many years for it to develop. My son mistook the nuanced unspoken (or joked about) parts of our marriage for some sort of male/female traditional marriage role BS. He was seeing the end result of years of small compromises, fights, agreements, and other stuff that lead to the way our marriage works today.  
  
Now, while I was having that talk with my oldest boy, my wife and daughter were talking with his ex-girlfriend. We all really like her, and would hate to see them broken up forever. They discovered all the things my son wasn't telling me.   
  
From what they learned, my oldest son has been listening to certain podcasters and TikTok influencers that are very misogynistic. My son wanting her to move out of state with him, while she was reluctant to do so, is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to their real problems. When they talked about their futures they had wildly differing views on what those futures would be like. For example, he got it stuck in his head that women should do the lions share of the housework.

To be fair, doing the dishes seems like it takes a lot more effort than doing laundry, since most of the time is spent waiting for a dryer cycle to finish. But doing the laundry is more than just washing and folding clothes while watching TV or playing video games. It's changing the linens, changing out the towels and robes in the bathrooms, and changing out and cleaning the curtains around the home. None of my kids has ever had to put fresh sheets on their beds, because I do it for them. My wife has done our bed maybe once in the last half dozen years. Laundry, like dishes, are monsters that you battle endlessly. In a good marriage you and your partner fights those battles side by side, no matter how you spilt up the workload exactly.

Anyway, I hate to see them remain broken up, but my son needs to grow up a bit before that has any hope of happening. I suggested therapy, though I doubt my son will look into it. He's at the age where he thinks he knows everything. He hasn't attained the wisdom to realize that no matter how perfect we think we are, everyone screws up, and sometimes the way we think is very very wrong.

"TIFU by not paying attention and permanently disfiguring the nail on my thumb
This happened last early last year but I just recently got the news my thumb nail is forever disfigured.

So last year while I was at work I was called to take a customer's passport picture. While I was",,"of this is:

"TIFU... By ordering pizza (Not NSFW but some mature-ish content)
Now before you get the wrong idea, I'm a girl. I was born a girl and I identify as a girl, I have my whole life. So keeping that in mind, I live in a relatively rural place, we have some fast food chains but mostly 'mum & pop' style places. I'm pretty active in my community so most people would recognize me or my name, including the local pizza place. My mom sent me an email with a pizza order for the pizza place (as it takes orders by email and phone) so I went to find the places email (it's not saved in my phone) and forwarded my latest email, which I thought was the pizza order. It was not. While I googled the email, some weirdo (I'm 15 if that changes anything) sent me a d!ck pic. And I sent it to the pizza place where my crush works. I didn't realize until I got called by the place and who other than to pick up then the boy I liked. He said that while it was a nice veiw (?) I would need to resubmit a proper order.

"TIFU by sleeping with my best friend and getting caught by her boyfriend
A couple weeks ago my good friend we'll call Ashley (36f) got fired for arriving at work intoxicated. We were actively communicating with each other that day because I had left work early the same day so she called me right away when it happened. After talking for about an hour I asked if she needed company because she was very distressed and she told me to come over but leave before her boyfriend was home as he dislikes me since we feed each others demons of vice. When I arrived Ashley was very intoxicated and acting strange. She began throwing herself at me and I refused to engage since she was intoxicated and we were strictly platonic friends. I 24m decided to start drinking with her and I got her laughing and kept her mood up. Soon after she began throwing herself at me again and since I was intoxicated too I made the poor choice to roll with it. After making out for about half an hour Ashley gave me a mystery drug she pulled out from her bra. Which made me incredibly drunk within minutes. She hadn't taken any with me but probably had before I arrived. After making out and expressing hidden feelings for each other I carried Ashley to her room and things got out of hand quickly. I won't go into detail but we definitely slept together. Drunk and high I passed out next to her in bed without going home. I woke up to her incredibly angry boyfriend Jeff(33m) I somehow convinced Jeff it wasn't what it looked like and left as soon as I was sober enough to drive. I texted them around 8 asking for my wallet when Jeff blew up on me claiming I took advantage of his girlfriend and that she told him everything. It's been a couple weeks now we've had no contact because I've been blocked and if a mutual friend reaches out on my behalf she gets very angry and hangs up. This feels worse than a breakup. I feel like I just lost the best person I had in my life. We were like mustard and ketchup. We spent every minute together at work and hung out like 3 times a week, totally inseparable.

"TIFU by booking a doctors appointment for my little sister without telling our mother
I 26M am the eldest of 4 siblings, there is a two year age gap between my closest in age brother and I, however there is an 11 year age difference between me and my other brother and a 13 year age difference between my sister and I. My youngest two siblings and I have the same mother but different fathers. Last weekend my mother and her boyfriend went out of town so I was looking after my youngest siblings. I am very protective over my sister as I was born female and during my teenage years when she was very young I essentially raised her as my mother worked long hours and my sisters dad was never around. I am also very protective of her because I know what it can be like living with my mother as a young woman/girl. My mother doesn't do it on purpose but she can be very judgemental and unintentionally cruel towards my sister like she was to me when I was younger. I am also very protective because when I was a little older than her, her father (my mums partner at the time) started SAing me repeatedly and it went on for years. All this to say I am very protective over my baby sister and I have a few reasons to be.  
So this past weekend when my mother and her boyfriend (not my siblings father) were out of town and I was looking after my siblings and my sister confided in me that she feels like she is never listened to at home, she thinks she most likely has ADHD and she is sometimes scared of my mother. She also confided that when she has mentioned wanting to go to a doctor to get tested for ADHD my mother has brushed her off and said that shes just a kid and kids are just like that.  
This struck a nerve with me because as an adult I am currently working with my therapist to get diagnosed for ADHD as I wasn't able to as a kid for the same reason my sister hasn't been able to, my mother said I was just being a kid.  
This is where I may have fucked up, I called our doctors office and booked a doctors appointment for my sister without telling my mum. My thought process was if my mum won't take her I will.  
Tonight my sister sent me a text message to say that mum received a text message from the doctors office confirming the appointment for tomorrow, and when my mum asked her what it was about my sister told her it was an appointment I booked to discuss the possibility of her having ADHD. She told me my mum left the house with her bag, phone and keys. I tried to call my mum but she sent me straight to voice mail. After about an hour or so, my mum called me back and said she was very hurt by what I'd done and said I'd lied to her about wanting my sister to come over to my house after school tomorrow so I could take her to the doctors. I tried to explain to my mum that my sister has tried to talk to her about it in the past but she said that never happened and then called my 13 year old sister a ""fucking lying bitch"" I will admit I got a bit mad at that and told her she shouldn't call her 13 year old daughter that. She said that my sister never mentioned anything to her and when I said I was sorry she hung up on me.  
This was a few hours ago now and I'm worried that I've ruined my relationship with my mother and that she may restrict me from being able to see my sister.  
Does anyone have any advice about what I can do? I'm at a total loss",Booked a doctors appointment for my little sister who I'm very protective of but didn't tell me mother and now I feel like I've ruined my relationship with my mother completely,I booked a doctors appointment for my little sister without telling my mum.
"TIFU by sending a voice note rant… to the wrong person (waiting for HR to call me up anytime)
This just happened, and I need to disappear from society. I was having one of those days - work was stressful, everything was annoying, and I just needed to vent. I ranted about my workload, my micromanaging coworker, and how my absolute shitbox of a car is barely hanging on. I bought it with some money I won on Stake slots around $4,500 and let’s just say I’m learning the hard way that cheap isn’t always a bargain. Between that and work frustrations, I was unloading a lot.



Well, guess what? I sent the voice note to the exact wrong person. Not my friend. Not even someone neutral. Nope - I sent it to the coworker I was complaining about.



The moment I hit send and saw their name, my soul left my body. I went into full panic mode, trying to figure out if I could somehow delete it before they heard it (spoiler: I couldn’t). Then I saw the dreaded double ticks turn blue so guess they played it.



They haven’t responded yet, but I’m 90% sure they’re going to send it to HR. If I get called into the office and they actually play the recording in front of me, I might just evaporate on the spot. Do I pretend it never happened? Do I follow up with some damage control? Do I just quit my job and move to another country?","Ranted about work and my barely-functioning car in a voice note, sent it to the coworker I was complaining about instead of my friend, and now I might be getting HR’d.","I sent a voice note to the wrong person, and I’m pretty sure they’re going to send it to HR."

TIFU So the other day, I was heating up some food in the 7 month old air fryer. It suddenly died. i checked the plug, on/off. Nothing. I pressed the GFI, nothing. I tried it in another outlet. Nothing. So, I unplugged it and ordered a new one, the cheapest one available at a big box store where I happened to have lots of points, making it cost almost free. It came two days later. I took it out of the box and put the ""broken"" one in. Took it out to the dumpster, and tossed it in. Later that day, I plugged in the can opener--nothing. I went back to the GFI outlet and realized there are 2 buttons! I pressed the other button, and the can opener worked! I realized that the air fryer I threw out was fine! It was still in the dumpster, but it was at the bottom and there was no way I could reach it. So, it went with the trash collection a few days later.

"TIFU by spreading spilt diesel on a shared parking area

As I drove into a shared outdoor parking area, my car leaked diesel, leaving a mess everywhere. I initially tried to soak it up with baking soda—since that was all I had—but then, in a moment of poor judgment, I rinsed it with water. That only made things worse, spreading the diesel across multiple parking spots.

I've been pouring water on it and scrubbing, but I’m worried it’s going to leave a permanent stain. I have no idea what else to do, and from what I’ve read, diesel doesn’t evaporate and tends to stain concrete.

The parking area is managed by the company that oversees my flats (UK), so I plan to report it to them and face whatever consequences come my way. I have home insurance, and I’m hoping it might cover the damage—otherwise, I have no way to pay for it.

For some background: a few weeks ago, my car's fuel injector failed. After waiting nine hours for breakdown assistance, it was eventually towed home the next day. I hired a mobile mechanic to fix it, which went fine at first. Then, my ABS sensor failed, causing the car to judder, so the mechanic returned to fix that too. After driving it again, I noticed fuel leaking onto the ground. Upon inspecting it, I realized it was coming from one of the pumps. The mechanic came back and repaired it but insisted he hadn’t touched that part. I can't really argue with him. Altogether, these repairs have already cost me around £1,200.

I’m naturally an anxious person and an overthinker, and right now, I feel like I’ve seriously messed up with no way out.","My car leaked diesel in a shared parking area.

"TIFU by trying wine for the first time
[For context, I am 17M] At the moment I am in the bathroom writing this mortified, you'll see why 

Well, it's spring break right now, and like many other teenagers, I'm on vacation with family. Now my trip has been amazing. So far, nothing has been *shitty* except for the fact that I have a shitty lingering cough that hasn't gone away in weeks, just amazing! Now, I am staying with my cousin, her husband, kids, and another cousin. So naturally, night time comes around, all the kids are asleep (except me as I'm the oldest), and my cousins get the brilliant idea to pull out that one bottle of wine and start drinking. 

Now that's fine, obviously! They're adults and can drink if they want there's nothing wrong with that. But I want some, and they obviously won't give me some. So I don't even bother asking. Well 10 P.M rolls around (this story happened yesterday and today by the way) and everyone is dead asleep which makes sense because they all did have to go to work today except for 2 of the moms. I'm upstairs in my room, and I start thinking to myself:

""Hmmmmm, as a teenager, I've never really done anything bad?"" So I get the genius idea of going downstairs and sneaking a glass, so I do it! It was a medium-sized glass, and I poured a decent amount to taste it. I taste it and I love the taste it's not bad! But I wasn't going to have anymore. I was in the living room and decided to lay on the sofa and watch YouTube on my phone, but remember that stupid ass dry cough? Well it starts again and it won't go away eventually my cousin wakes up to check on me and there I am on the sofa practically dying because of my sickness (I had a high fever at this point too) so she checks my temperature and it was high 100° she's shocked and so upset asking why I didn't tell her so she gives me 4 pills which he antibiotics and sends me back upstairs.

Now... here's the fuckup and it's bad out of those 4 pills. 2 were laxatives, and she wasn't paying attention to the bottle of medicine as she gave them to me. and we all know what those do. I go upstairs and fall asleep at this point it was like 12:00 A.M well a few hours later I wake up and feel something *wet* on my pajamas and God I wish it would have been piss or semen instead. But to my absolute horror, I feel the back of my pajamas, and I had a diarrhea shit explosion. LUCKILY I didn't get any on the carpet or my blankets so I quickly get up and run to the bathroom to clean myself and shower at this point it was 5:00 A.M but I didn't even get the chance to shower because as soon as I was going to go in my asshole gets the urge to shit again. So I sit on the toilet and let it loose and to add more HORROR IT WAS RED, RED BECAUSE OF THE WINE. I start panicking thinking it's blood about to call 911, but then I remember it was the stupid ass wine I decided to try. Guys, the fart explosion was loud when I sat down on the toilet. I'm not even joking. I woke up my little cousin who was sleeping in the room next to the bathroom. And it's horrible. 

At the moment, it's 8:16 A.M., and I am still in this bathroom naked with soiled clothes on the floor. And more shit is to come, so please guys send prayers to me, and that was my fuckup for yesterday, and today, I think the wine made it worse. And I know I'm going to be sore later.","I decided to try wine when I was sick. Later, my cousin gave me 4 antibiotic pills, and 2 were laxatives, which resulted in a poop attack.

"TIFU by shattering my whole family’s dynamics
Technically, it was two days ago but it all erupted today. 

I (21F) am visiting my family from abroad. During this visit my younger sister (19F) stopped by to also visit and brought along her boyfriend (24M) for the first time. They were only here, at my parents house, for a weekend and after they left my parents began talking... badly about him in particular. 

All of this is important context, though I know it seems kind of irrelevant. My sister has had a turbulent past and has gotten in some serious trouble in her younger teen years which definitely influences how my parents (and I suppose me too) perceive her actions. Neither of my parents really like her boyfriend, after they left they went on rants about it. They mainly spoke about how the thought he was a cheap stake and how they were worried that my sister was paying the way for him (implying he was a bum), that he lacked chivalry, lacked manners, and was essentially of lower class and were embarrassed that my sister was dating him. 

Well, this past weekend my sister wanted to spend time with me so she picked me up and had me stay with her. During this stay we ended up having a long-winded conversation about how my sister feels unappreciated by our parents, how she feels overly critiqued, overwhelmed, etc. It was mostly her talking but there were a few moments during which I did validate her feelings, told her she was right, and I did inform her of what my parents had been saying about her relationship (mainly her boyfriend) behind her back. This has led to an incredibly big fight between her and my mom in particular, which has also turned into a big fight between my mom and me. 

Essentially, I really fucked up because I breeched my parents trust by telling my sister what they had been saying. My mom now blames me for turning my sister against her and is very very angry with me. 

My sister is also really angry with me because during the week between her visiting with her boyfriend and later coming to pick me up she had called me to ask about our inheritance on our dad's side. The call in itself had felt really inappropriate to me and had made me feel incredibly uncomfortable because she was essentially talking about our grandmother dying as if it were nothing and our dad inhereting a large sum of money (which he's stated he would use to pay off our student debts). What made me even more uncomfortable was that her boyfriend had been present during that call, and I hadn't known I was on speaker. I ended up telling my parents about it, and while I did tell my sister that I was really uncomfortable by the call and the fact her boyfriend had been there I did lie and say that I hadn't told my parents. (This was my dad's idea because he said if him and my mom laid into her about it she would know I blabbed and it would affect our relationship, so he said it was better if they pretended they didn't know and I acted as if I hadn't told). 

After the big blow up between my mom and my sister though, my mom demanded I tell my sister that they knew, so I did. And now everyone is mad at me, rightfully so, because I'm incapable of keeping my mouth shut and I meddled when I really didn't have any business getting in between their relationships/dynamics. 

And now I don't know what to do, but my mom is demanding I fix everything. But beyond apologizing to all three (which I've done, my dad took it the best whilst my mom took it the absolute worst), I'm completely lost.",I fucked up my family dynamic by meddling and breaching everybodies trust and don't know how to fix any of it.,I breeched my parents trust by telling my sister about her relationship with her boyfriend.

"TIFU paid for a puppy scam
I’ve been looking for another Dachshund lately for my current one and I came across a comment section in a Facebook group recommending a breeder page. I contacted the breeder and everything seemed legit. They asked me questions deeming if I was fit to handle a Dachshund and I even had to submit an application to get approved. I ended up choosing two puppies and my boyfriend gave me the money for a downpayment the “breeder” needed. 

I initially asked the breeder if we could use PayPal but she responded saying “her cards don’t work with PayPal” and I was so dumb and gave her the benefit of the doubt. I Apple Cashed her $750. She sent me over an invoice afterwards and that made me feel secure but a day later I had a gut feeling. She lives in a city 2 hours from me and my boyfriend and I were planning on picking the puppies up on Tuesday. This is why we did not try to see the dogs in person beforehand because of the distance and now I know this is a huge mistake. 

She sent me tons of pictures and videos of the dogs and their parents, and when I expressed concern over getting scammed she sent a paragraph saying something in the realm that she is a certified breeder of merit and that they would never try to cheat anyone out of their money. She sent the Apple Cash request and it was from a random iCloud account, not a phone number, and after I paid she kept saying she needed me to send a screenshot of the payment after I sent it and I did. 

After the payment my anxiety spiked and I decided to do reverse google search on the puppy pictures AND her pictures and they were all stolen from another breeder in Australia/puppy pictures from instagram. I feel so dumb and I know better which sucks. I just asked her for her phone number today which she kept repeating was on the “invoice” and when I called it was a random las vegas number that went straight to voicemail. I told her that I want to FaceTime with my puppies and she agreed 20 minutes ago. She said she would “reach out to me when she is ready to FaceTime”. This was 20 minutes ago and I have yet to be blocked. 

She wants the rest of the money in cash so that is a good sign imo, but moral of the story NEVER pay a puppy breeder a downpayment before speaking to them on the phone or seeing the puppies in person. Also reverse image search all pictures on the facebook page. I thought because her page looked polished and informative with over 2k followers she was legit and I’m coming to realize I was so wrong.
I contacted my bank and the representative made it seem like it was likely I would get my money back, but after doing my own research even if my bank does refund the money back to me/dispute the transaction, Apple Cash will give me a delinquent account and make me negative which in turn could ruin my cr",,TIFU paid for a puppy scam and I don't know what to do.
"TIFU by making tribbles without a mask
Don't ask how, in my infinite wisdom, as someone who is already irritated by floating dust and hay fibers, that I would cut and then sew faux fur bare faced. Anyway, I sew a bunch of tribbles, get enough fur to rival a cat's shed on my clothes, and later end up with feeling like I have hair in my throat. I think, ""ah shit, allergies! I thought I outgrew them."" 

Today, I do the exact same thing. The cough returns and I feel like the tribbles have had a tiny baby in my throat. For a moment, I wonder if I'm going to need to go to urgent care (or worse) because I decided to sew some fucking tribbles. I managed to gargle out the feeling in the shower and after a quick google search, I have found out you can get ""groomer's lung"" from long term exposure to fur fibers.

"TIFU took a gas station boner pill drink
So about last week I went to a Walgreens-Urgent Care combo since my partner needed to get a urine test for a UTI. While waiting around for the appointment to be finished, I ended up looking in the sexual wellness section because I needed lube and sometimes like to laugh at the strange male sex health products. 

Since all I hear about gas station boner pills is that they’re snake oil and do not do anything, I had the bright idea of trying one out. I spotted one on the shelf that seemed the most interesting, the Extenze Original Formula Male Enhancement drink. Cherry flavor to top it off. The package was covered in a strange sticky substance (should’ve taken it as a sign) but said screw it, grabbed it and checked out. 

That drink sat in a cabinet for a week but we both agreed to try it out when the UTI passed and we were both in the mood. That day finally came and I grabbed that bottle, ripped the top off, and took a massive swig like I was in the desert and dying of dehydration. 

The first 30 minutes, I felt nothing. After that, I entered hell. 

That shit made me feel like the incredible hulk. That shit made be feel like the terminator. That shit made me feel like the predator. That shit made me feel like max payne. That shit is what Hunter S Thompson was on when he was writing The Rum Diary. I could feel my heart beating out of my chest and I do not know if it was even beating in time. I thought I needed to go get an EKG but took a muscle relaxer instead to kill the feeling. Probably one of the worst feelings I’ve ever had and I do not recommend it.","Took a gas station boner pill, felt like I was going to have a heart attack.

"TIFU by posting a situation on a Facebook group and sounding like a pick me…
So hopefully they don’t find this bc then I’ll be banned since I’m not supposed to talk about it existing begin with. but I really like that group and think it’s a really good tool.

So basically I don’t log into that group often but women talk about the men they’re dating there and ask for advice. A while back I saw a post of a guy friend that I hook up with a couple of times a year and I thought it was funny. I thought it was funny because I knew him. someone was asking about him and if he has any red flags. And in my opinion he doesn’t have any, unless you count not looking for anything serious a red flag. I know everyone’s situation is different and just because we have a good understanding of our relationship doesn’t mean someone else will get the same experience. I didn’t feel the need to comment since the post was old and the lady posting got a good amount of varying answers, but overall I think they were productive. Some mentioned he was not looking for anything serious and others mentioned that he’s a lovebomber. 

I was surprised I found people had talked about a person I personally know and again, that’s why thought it was a little funny. There was no threat to anyone and neither do I think he’s a threat. I felt it would’ve been kind of funny too for him to see the comments but obviously for safety and rules I couldn’t (and wouldn’t) show him. I didn’t have anyone to talk to about this so I posted about the situation in the group itself thinking they would understand but most of the women there called me a pick me. I thought it would be ok to talk about it there since I can’t talk about it anywhere else but apparently that was a bad idea. Those who got where I was coming from mentioned my wording was not the best and that it did come off as pick me so I  apologized for that. Some people said that I was a pick me for allowing myself to be in a causal relationship and that I felt superior to them for it. Which is not the case. Some felt that I put the girl in danger somehow for it, which I think was bc I mentioned it would be funny to show my friend which I would never do! I thought it was funny bc I saw someone I know and in a “I know something you don’t way.” But yeah I obviously messed up for not wording it correctly and also for telling them I guess. I feel bad because of the misunderstanding but also most women were rude about it and not gonna lie it hurt my feelings.

"TIFU by falling for a Twitter scam.
Earlier today I got a DM from a friend on Twitter saying that they accidentally reported me for fraud and to talk to a Twitter employee on Discord to get it fixed. 

I did so, gave the ""employee"" all the info they asked for, name, age, nation and state I live in. I even gave them a bank statement they asked for, which should've made me suspicious. Frankly I should've gotten suspicious when they asked me to change my Twitter email to the one they provided.

Then they said they found 129 instances of suspicious activity on my account and that I needed to send them $250 to sort it out. I have no financial information on my Twitter account and never try to buy or sell anything on Twitter.

I started Googling to see if this was a legit practice and found someone who almost got scammed the same way, by someone using the exact same name, except in that case the scammer wanted $1500.

I couldn't get cashapp to work which turned out to be a blessing in disguise, so they started pressuring me. Saying if I didn't cooperate in 20 minutes they would ban my account. I told them I knew it was a scam and they weren't getting a penny from me. They unfriended me on Discord after that.

The bad part is I'm logged out of my Twitter account and can't get back in even using the scammer's email, which tells me they cahnged the password. I sent a complaint in to Twitter support, which thankfully is a seperate website, but I'm not holding out hope that I'll get my account back.

"TIFU By eating chocolate while doing a yoga move
I recently started PT and was assigned several exercises to do to improve my core strength. This evening I was down on the floor doing all of them and I did all of the hard ones first, then I stood up took a quick break before doing the last couple that are more relaxing stretches. I deserve a treat though right for finishing the hard ones??? So I popped a slice of chocolate orange into my mouth and then got on all fours to do the yoga move ""cat/cow"" where you alternate between arching your back up like a scared cat and down like a relaxed cow. So I start doing this with the chocolate in my mouth as you do, And of course since it's yoga I automatically start doing the deep breathing that's associated with yoga in the nose out the mouth... On the second rep when I bring my head up and do a deep inhale through my nose I suck the chocolate into my nose causing an instant burning sensation. I try to ignore it and just finish the reps but it's getting worse and worse and then I start sneezing and chocolate is coming out my nose. Who knew that eating chocolate while doing yoga was so dangerous....

"TIFU By Leaving My Key In My Hotel Accommodation
I am currently in Greece, and I booked a hotel in Athens between 17 and 19 March. It has a private restroom, one queen bed, one single bed, Wi-Fi, and air conditioning/a heating system. It only costed me $74 for two nights, and I am in the very centre of Monastiraki, which meant noise would certainly be an issue as some restaurants decide to blast loud music.

My hotel includes three keys and a card used to gain electricity. Whenever I exit the hotel, I always bring my keys with me so I wouldn't get locked out, and I probably entered and exited the hotel room 4 times (twice on Monday, to leave my luggage and to check on the concert noise at 23:30 and twice on Tuesday, to visit the Acropolis/Agora and to visit the Archeological Museum after a brief nap).

However, today, I checked out of the Athenian hotels. I woke up at 7:20, and checked through the whole room before checking out. Even though I got everything out of the hotel room, I forgot to take out my hotel keys from the electricity card, and hence, I was locked out.

"TIFU by cheating on my gf and getting caught red handed
Okay so I (27M) royally f\*cked up. Like, my life is literally in shambles right now.

Been with my gf (26F) for 3 years. Everything was good. Or I thought it was. I got bored or something, idk what my stupid brain was thinking.

Started texting this coworker. One thing led to another and yeah... we hooked up a few times. I was being SO obvious about it too. Coming home late, guarding my phone like it contained nuclear codes, making up BS excuses about ""working late."" Classic cheater moves that any idiot could spot from a mile away.

My gf isn't stupid. She noticed but didn't say anything at first. Turns out she's the primary account holder on our phone plan (we've been sharing one to save money). She went through the billing records and saw exactly how often I was texting this one number. Like, HUNDREDS of texts at weird hours. She could see all the late night calls too.

She even went as far to use this site to look up who owned that phone number. The search pulled up my coworker's full profile which linked to all her social media. That's how my gf discovered it was someone from my workplace. She even used the same site to confirm that the address I'd been ""working late"" at was actually my coworker's apartment. The site showed property records and everything.

So two days ago I walk in and she's just sitting at our kitchen table with this folder. No tears, no screaming, just this look of pure disappointment that made me want to crawl into a hole and die.

She slides the folder over and I open it... she had printed out months of phone records highlighting this one number over and over. Next to it was the printed report showing my coworker's name, address, social media profiles, and even her work history confirming we worked at the same place. She had even made a freaking spreadsheet comparing the times I was ""working late"" with location data showing I was at my coworker's place.

All she said was ""I needed to be 100% sure. Now I am.""

My stuff was already packed. Her cousin was waiting outside with his truck to help me move out. That's how prepared she was.

I'm at my buddy's place now and she's already blocked me everywhere. 3 years down the drain because I couldn't keep it in my pants.

Moral of the story: Don't cheat. And if you're dumb enough to do it anyway, remember there are websites out there that can connect dots you didn't even know existed.","Cheated on my gf with a coworker, she caught me by checking our phone records and using a background check site to connect all the dots, now I'm homeless and single.",Cheated on my gf and got caught red handed.
"TIFU by not setting an alarm.
Last night I got off work early, had dinner and  was looking around trying to decide what to do with the several hours before I had to be in bed. 

I didn't want to watch TV, play games, read or stare mindlessly at my phone and I wasn't particularly interested going outside seeing as it was absolutely pouring. 

Lacking anything better to do I started reorganizing my yarn. Well I come across some yarn I had forgotten about and it sparks a memory of a pattern I had been looking at, so I pull up the pattern to check if it was the correct size yarn and it was! 

Now I've figured out what I am doing for the evening. I put on a podcast in the background, get out my knitting needles and cast on. 

I get so into knitting that it isn't until the latest episode of my podcast end and it switches to a random one with a deeply annoying presenter that I shake myself out of my zone, front panel of the sweater half knit. 

I stretch and check the time only to realise that not only have I completely missed my bedtime but I only have 3 hours before I have to be up for work. 

And the worst part is I know myself well enough to know that if I get really involved in something that I will not notice time passing at all. I almost always set a timer if I have a specific time I need to do something but because I was sure I had so much time before needing to get ready for bed I didn't set my alarm to get myself to put the needles down and now I'm dragging ass in the middle of my work shift.",I forgot hyperfocus was a thing and didn't set an alarm to make myself go to bed on time so I got less than 3 hours of sleep on a work night,Don't set an alarm.
"TIFU By Reading The Word Receptionist
Just remembered this little incident while flicking through comments.

I used to have a job where I went to businesses, schools, etc to empty the sanitary bins in ladies toilets, as well as other things like refill air fresheners, replace urinal mats etc. Not a glamorous job I know, but it's better than being on benefits and it kept a roof over my head.

Anyway, one place I went to (everyone had set routes that were either weekly, fortnightly or monthly so we were  the regular service operative for said place we went to) was a little office and I pressed the buzzer to get let in. As I was waiting, I looked around and saw the word ""receptionist"" underneath the buzzer.

Usually in situations like this, they answer and I just say ""I'm here to do the bins"". But today I had a complete brain fart and as soon as someone answered I blurted out ""I'm here to do the receptionist.....sorry, the bins! I'm here to do the bins!""

To say it was awkward when I went to get the sheet to say that I'd been there and done what i had to signed by the receptionist would be an understatement. 

Thankfully that office was one of my monthly routes so gave a bit of time for everyone to forget it ever happened but my coworkers didn't let me forget it for a while.

Im somewhat recently single and have been trying to get back out there. I thought one of his friends was kinda funny and did work in the same industry as me. 

Fast forward and I was talking to housemate and asked him if his friend was single. His reaction kinda took me aback. He grimaced and was like ""yes"" and I was like oh ok I think he's funny.

Hopefully this doesn't break any rules, please let me explain!


So I'm a white woman and I. Love. Watermelon. Flavor. I was getting ready for a hike and bought a watermelon flavored energy drink, watermelon flavored gum, watermelon flavored gummies, and watermelon flavored breath mints (did you know that was a thing?? Cause I didn't!)


Now, this poor cashier was ringing me up and mentioned that I must love watermelon flavor. Now, this wonderful lady was a black woman. So of course, in a moment of absolute stupidly, my dumbass goes ""Well watermelon is just the best, you know what I mean?""

"TIFU by getting me and my boyfriend banned from a liquor store
I'd like to explain because the situation isn't as bad as it sounds!

I'm 20 and about to be 21 in three weeks. My boyfriend of 2 years is 21. He recently broke his leg and is in a full leg cast and using crutches. Which means he cannot carry anything while using his crutches. We are visiting some friends of ours who live in a different state, and every time we travel, my BF likes to buy a bottle of liquor from each place. He has a pretty big collection now, and it's pretty cool.

So, because we were traveling, he decided he wanted to pick up a bottle of Kentucky bourbon from Kentucky. So we headed to a liquor store near our hotel. The store had a sign on the door stating that nobody under 18 was allowed inside and nobody under 21 was allowed to buy anything.  We headed inside, and I waved to the guy at the counter. He greeted us, and my BF asked him if he could point us to the section that had \*real\* Kentucky bourbon in it. The guy was pretty nice and told us where to look. We headed to the section, and my BF took a while looking around and finally decided on a specific bottle, which happened to be on the lowest shelf. 

Since he one can't reach the shelf and two is on crutches and struggles to hold anything, I reached down and grabbed the bottle. We also grabbed 2 other bottles our friends asked us to pick up for them. We both headed for the register, and I set the bottles down. We chatted with the guy for a bit before he asked for my BF's ID. He showed it, and the guy began to ring us up. Before we got to pay, he turned to me and asked to see my ID. 

Confused, I asked why he needed it since I wasn't buying anything. The worker said I looked young, so I just shrugged and handed him my ID. He checked it over and even scanned it before handing it back and apologizing. The worker then informed us that he couldn't legally sell us anything. 

Confused, we asked why, and he said that since I wasn't 21 and clearly the one that was carrying the items, he couldn't sell them to us. Confused again, I asked him to clarify why he couldn't sell us the liquor. He explained really kindly why and then said that since we technically broke the rules, he'd have to ban us from the store permanently, and since we were really nice about the entire situation, he wouldn't call the cops.

We apologized and quickly left. In the end, we just headed to our friend's house, and he went with my BF to get the items. So, no biggie, but I did end up getting us banned from shopping at a random liquor store in  Kentucky.","I didn't know it was illegal for anyone under 21 to carry bottles out/around a store for the person who is 21 and purchased them, which resulted in me and my BF getting banned from a liquor store in a state we don't live in.","Boyfriend broke his leg, couldn't carry anything while using his crutches, got banned from a liquor store because I wasn't 21."

"TIFU by eating a pancake that went bad in my car and discovering I had cancer
Obligatory, this happened back in June of last year.

So, yeah. Title pretty much sums it up.

I live in Texas and it was a hot summer day, and like the absolute genius I am, I left two pancakes in my car. It must have been there from 10 am to about 6 pm as I was doing quite a bit of errands and shopping, long enough that it basically slow-cooked itself in the sweltering heat. Now, instead of throwing it away like a normal person, my dumb ass thought, Hey, this is fine, right? I ate one of the pancakes when I got home and put the other in the fridge.

Next morning I felt a little off but hey it is what it is. I pulled the leftover pancake from the fridge, took a bite and realized it tasted a lil funny. I chalked it up to bad fridge taste. 

I went out with family to a buffet and felt kinda off, a little confused and not very hungry. I drank alot of sprite and ate some shrimp but felt like I got hit by a truck. 


A few hours later, right before bed, my body was like, We’re gonna make you regret every decision you’ve ever made. I got hit with the worst fever, chills, and pain imaginable. You know when you feel so bloated you know you need to throw up to feel better? I struggled to get comfortable in bed and it hit me, i need to throw up like right now. I made it to the bathroom just in time to throw up a pink sludge. Perfect. I thought i could just go back to bed at this point but n o p e. I must have thrown up at least eight times. My throat was absolutely raw at this point it was 2 in the morning. I had work in a few hours but I had this feeling where I just felt like I was dreaming and I was pretty confused. 

I let my family know, hey I think I need to go to urgent care. Turns out, I had severe sepsis. Ended up being moved to the hospital where they kept me for a week hooked up to IV antibiotics, feeling like death itself.

While they were running a bunch of tests and scans, the doctors were like, Hey, you’ve got cysts on both ovaries. Might wanna check that out.  

But wait, there’s more!

During the scans, they also found a weird lytic bone lesion on my hip and femur. More tests, more scans, and surprise!—I had multiple myeloma. 

And those ovarian cysts? Long story short, surgery happened this past week, and I lost both my ovaries. Turns out, those cysts weren’t just cysts. They were teratomas—aka creepy tumor babies that had h a i r. Sizes of lemons. Both of them.


So, to recap: my incredibly dumb decision to eat a sun-baked pancake somehow led to finding out I had two ovarian monsters and cancer.

If I hadn’t gotten sepsis and ended up in the hospital, I wouldn’t have known until way later, and things could have been much worse. So, in the most messed-up way possible, that stupid pancake might have actually saved my life.","Ate a pancake that slow-cooked in my car, got severe sepsis, lost both ovaries to teratomas, and accidentally discovered I had bone marrow cancer.",TIFU by eating a pancake that went bad in my car and discovering I had cancer.
"TIFU by being a smartass to my mother and a jerk to my brother
So I (16f) was in the car with my mom and my brother (13m) on the way home from a drs appointment. My brother jumped into the front seat and made a sarcastic comment. My mom called him an asshat. This is where the problem starts. 

My mom said that she was sorry she called my brother an asshat, and he said he was used to it because I called him an asshole all the time. My mom got mad at me, and we had a very civil discussion on my actions and my brothers. Now here is where I fucked up. My mom said that when my brother does annoying things, I have to gently call him out. I responded with “yeah, usually I just call him an asshole.” So you may be thinking, not that bad, but then my mom started yelling because she thought I was calling him an asshole again. And long story short, I was a smartass. 

She was saying things like “you have to be nicer to your brother” and I responding with “at least I’m not the one yelling.” She then started prattling off a list of things she was going to take away from me, including my PT appointment tomorrow. 

Long story short, I have chronic hip pain from hip dysplasia, that gets waaay worse if I don’t see my PT. She does a lot of manual therapy that is great for my hip that can’t be done at home. I really rely on my PT. 

Back to the story. I responded with “well, I will know who to blame when I need hip replacements at 30 from arthritis” when then responded with “or you will wish you were nicer to your brother” and I responded “or you will wish you didn’t overreact over a single fucking comment.” Now through all of this, my brother was still in the front seat. 

When we got home, my brother locked himself in the basement. After, my mom and I got into a yelling match. So uh yeah. I fucked up pretty bad during this match. 

When my mom wanted me to apologize, at first I refused saying things like “it is my brothers fault too, he is a jerk to me” and then when my mother (rightfully) continued to insist an apology I said “I am sorry you mis interpreted what I said”

So i called an Uber, i can’t drive but I’m studying for my learners permit and I can’t ride a bike to save my life without training wheels. 

I wanted to save some money because I want to buy an extension to keep my gaming laptop from overheating, I got the cheapest option which was an Uber XL for $13.07, I’m not obese (anymore), but it was my best option.

without realizing what I did, I ordered an uber 20 minutes away and the old guy was “hard of hearing” and only communicated by text. I stand outside 5 minutes before my Ubers arrive so I had time. I see the MF show up at the wrong address but before I can respond he text me “I arrived”, then immediately cancelled the ride. For example I live at house 431 and he arrived at house 425, far enough to see but I would have to walk for a minute. 

This was the first time an Uber cancelled a ride on me. I was about to be charged a fee but I didn’t have enough funds after the first charge so my bank kept declining, I only keep about $15 in my checking at a time and the rest I put in my savings. 

I ended up being even more late because of this, my grandmother reluctantly drove me after hearing what happened. I had to text customer support to get a refund and for some reason they gave me $20 in 2-3 business days, I’m never using Uber again though (except for UberEats).",", called an uber because I missed the bus in the rain but the uber showed up at the wrong address then canceled, fuck you lance I’m cold.","Ordered an Uber XL for $13.07, an old guy was “hard of hearing” and only communicated by text."
"TIFU by not properly updating my address with Progressive
Obligatory, this was a mess up over the past 5 years that just came to light today. 

So in May 2020 I bought a house and moved to a different town/county. However the zip codes were VERY similar (made up zip codes but basically 76499 and 76449). The “town” I was moving out of was a city with a relatively high crime rate and the town I was moving to was much quieter and safer. 

When I moved, I updated my address with Progressive and have been regularly receiving mail from them at my house. My account is on autopay and I haven’t made any claims or changes in the last 5 years, so I don’t ever log in to my account or pay attention to the paper work. 

Well today I just happened to finally log into my account for the first time in years and I noticed my street address was right, but it had the old zip code. I figured I’d just update it quick so that it was correct and didn’t create any possible issues in the future. 

As I was finishing updating the zip code, I was informed my bill would be dropping by $22 a month! For the last 5 years I’ve been overpaying for car insurance because I confused my zip codes. $1200+ given to Progressive for absolutely no reason. Certainly not a life changing amount, but infuriating nonetheless. 

I guess I should just be happy I finally got the savings on my car insurance I’ve been wanting lmao.",5 years ago I moved to a new town with a very similar zip code but a very different crime rate than my previous address.

"TIFU by almost sitting on a stranger.
So I (27F) went to a rave for the first time with my friends last night. This is not my typical environment and I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Now, here is important information to remember, I have a genetic disease where I cant see well or at all  in low light environments. 

So we get to the party, it's loud, it's crowded and I was ready to sit and enjoy a drink. After walking around for a bit, we finally see some chairs behind a sea of people. My friends squeeze in and I mindlessly followed them in my typical NPC state, taking the less crowded path on the other side. As i squeeze past the table, I go to take a seat on the empty spot that I thought I saw, except...y'know the spot was a living and breathing human! As my behind hovers above this poor unsuspecting victim my friend calls out to me and I realize my transgressions.

Immediately,  I went into my regular reaction to embarrassment- paralysis! My friend stepped in and diligently apologized for me.

"TIFU By sleeping with my friend
I understand that this kind of story is kinda dulled for this Page but a i wanna start anyway, and algo English isn't my star line up so bear with me.
I (M25) have been working in a pizza buffet for almost 8 years, is was my first job and has been dulled down to the point I only go on weekends for half of the day, it's easy money and the hours are adjusted for my real job and school, in this time I've gotten to know the owners and their families, which includes their niece lets call her Sonya (F18) but a the time I met her she was 15 or 16, and at some point she started working with me at the buffet, so we worked together for over a year, and in that time I became a aware that she liked me, and maybe out off cowardice I never told her straight that I didn't want to be with her, her age being the deal breaker for me, as time passed she left the restaurant and went out had a few boyfriends and i remained alone. cut to September of last year where she started texting me again after 6 months of her turning 18 and not talking to me, cuz of her bf, she told me all about it and we had discussions and chats and how they ended things. 

Now cut to last month when she returned to the pizza shop for weekend work, this is the part where I introduce my friend Mike (M20) who has been working with me for more than 6 months, he truly is my brother and my friend we've drink together, we've shared together, an absolutely unite of a homie and a better man than me.
so Sonya liked him and told me if I could help I did outta love for my friends and convinced him to go out with us, she made her move and they kissed, I left with a forced smile and return to my house feeling alone and stupid, guess it was that I never got the chance with her. for the next week she told me all about him and how she is beginning to have feelings for him but he isn't looking for anything serious, i was glad for them but still felt like shh. and last week in talks with Sonya she told me that she used to have feelings for me and I said I knew, from that point it escalated and the next day we had sex. and now I'm in this awful point where I have feelings for this girl and she had or has feelings for me and my friend. we had sex couple times before we all saw each other in the restaurant and it was torture, she flirt with me and him and i just felt angry at me and her, but the people at work know about em and I felt impotent. and today they are still going out causualy and I'm still in a position where idk if I'm waiting o just doing things wrong, I am enamored by this girl, she has been in my live for some time and have more than a crush and I don't want to rush or ended, so yeah today I ef up

what should I do for the sake of my friend and my feelings for her?",i helped setting up 2 good friends and had sex with one a week later,I (M25) slept with my best friend (M20) and now I'm in a relationship with her niece (F18) and I don't know what to do.
"TIFU by forgetting to keep my TLE's up to date
A few days ago my astronomer brother learned of the oppertunity to photograph the ISS with dragon attached, and wanted to know more details about the pass so i fired up gpredict, it's probably the best satalite tracker out there, used by radio hams all over the world, i use it mainly for tracking weather and amateur sats, such as the ISS when they announce an ARISS event, or when there will be a weather sat pass so i can grab the signal and pull the image from it.

The first red flag was that the pass he mentioned wasn't showing up in the ephemeris, there was plenty of passes, just not this one as this specific time, but i found a decent pass, and he asked where the ISS was now, just in the gulf of mexico.

Next he asked me to cross check the offical ISS tracker to make sure it wasn't off, and that's where i discovered my mistake, the ISS was actually over austrailia.

It turns out gpredict uses something called TLEs to make accurate pass forecasts and to work out where the sat is, it's some numbers that describe the orbit of the sat, they need updating, but gpredict doesn't update them unless you use the software regularly, last time i used gpredict was over a month ago.

I updated the TLEs and everything is nice and accurate, but the damage was done, my brother now thinks gpredict sucks, doesn't reccomend it to anyone, and uses stellarium instead.","Wrecked an astronomers first impression of a world renowned satalite tracking software by not updating the satalite trajectory magic in over a month, leading to completely inaccurate passes and orbits","My brother thinks gpredict sucks, and doesn't update TLEs."

I asked her if there was anything else but she didn’t seem to under stand me so I asked where she was from and she says Venezuela and I’m like “ok cool, have a good day” and she says “bye, you too”. She goes to leave and turns the corner.

"TIFU by grabbing the wrong dropper for my eyes.
Obligatory this did not happen today, but almost a decade ago, just thought I’d share! 

I wear glasses and for a period of a few months back when I was 15 I decided to try out contacts. I loved them! However, I needed regularly apply eye drops to avoid dryness. During this time, I was also treating my cat for worms using a dropper around the same size as my eye drops. You see where I’m going with this. 

Cue me, in jazz band, front and center lead saxophone. In the middle of us playing a song where I didn’t need to play for a long period of time,I reached into my back pocket to apply some drops to my eyes real quick. As soon as I did so, my eyes started burning HORRIBLY. It took me a second to realize this wasn’t normal. So I looked down and, you guessed it, I had squirted CAT DEWORMER into my eyeballs. I screamed, everybody stopped playing, and I had to admit to everybody what I had just idiotically done to myself. I was such a fool.

"TIFU by buying what I thought was coffee creamer
For context, I am an absolute sucker for anything with a seasonal flavor. I make apple cakes for family using boiled cider in the fall. It's not available pre-made in my country so I reduce fresh unfiltered apple juice for about 3hrs with some spices until it's about a honey consistency. I added it to coffee and cocktails just to see what it was like. It's fantastic and I find myself craving apple coffee often but am not willing to spend 3hrs simmering down juice. I've found a few coffeehouse where I can get apple lattes. They're only available from September through December and thus not in prime iced coffee seasons, a tragedy. So I bought a few pre-made syrups and they were all disgusting. Either sickly sweet, too artificial, or uncomfortably tart.

Imagine my joy when I found out my favorite fake milk brand made an apple creamer that was actually good. Really, really good. Unfortunately it's hard to find and disappears by mid November. Plus the bottles are pretty small. It lasts until February though so I tend to stock up. 

It's mid February and I've just finished my last bottle of creamer. I decide to try my local Grocery Outlet, a chain that mostly sells food that's overstock or out of season stuff. I find my creamer! And it's in a big bottle! I've never seen this size before but maybe it's like a Costco size. I buy three bottles because it doesn't go bad until June. I happily make my daily iced coffee and drink it as I do my morning activities. It's delightful  and I keep doing this for a few days. Sometimes even making myself a second coffee because this batch is better than normal.

Until one morning I skip breakfast and while painting realise my hands are shaking. I shrug it off as just one of my health issues acting up. Until it happens again. And again. When I go to throw out the first bottle I look at it again as I peel off the label to recycle the bottle.

It is not creamer. It is pre-made latte. I have been adding coffee to my coffee. Where normally I add creamer, ice, and water to my keurig small setting I've just been adding this and ice because it isnt as sweet and doesn't need watering down. I've been at least doubling my caffeine intake.","the ""creamer"" I've been adding to my coffee is actually a pre-made latte and I've been unknowingly doubling my caffeine intake",I bought a bunch of fake milk creamer and now I'm sick to my stomach.
"TIFU by making a typo on an email that was blasted out to clients
I work in the finance industry - specifically at a hedge fund. I am on the marketing/investor communications team and handle a lot of stuff that goes out to clients constantly. Today, I was preparing our invitations to our firm's webinars. I diligently went through the invitation, double-checking all the dates, making sure there were no typos, and, in general, being very careful to ensure nothing was wrong. I felt accomplished with the final result because it was error-free. I continued the usual process of preparing these materials, sending them out to our external distributors, etc. I also prepared the same thing in our program to send to specific distribution lists. I could have sworn I checked everything twice. I could have sworn it was all correct. I sent it out only to start receiving a flurry of emails pointing out that I had the same date twice for both webinars instead of the two separate dates. I am gutted; I feel like I let my team down. I am hiding in the bathroom because I cannot bring myself together. The official invitation was correct, and the hyperlinks brought people to the correct registrations, which displayed the correct dates. But the body of the email has two sets of the same date instead of the two consecutive days. It's not a big deal- I doubt most people would notice, but for some reason, this has sent me spiraling. My direct supervisor even emailed me, stating she didn't understand what happened and why I got this wrong. I know I won't lose my job, but important people made some sermi-public emails about it.

"TIFU as Wingman - The Tragicomedy
It was one of those nights that begins with great expectations and ends in a haze of fog and self-reflection. My journey led me, along with a merry band of compatriots, into the depths of Aargau—more specifically, to Baden, to a club called Nordportal. But the starting point of this adventurous endeavor was Olten, where we gathered, bound by tradition and youthful recklessness.

The train ride was marked by excessive consumption of the finest Belvedere vodka—a plan that would soon reveal itself to be a double-edged sword. Two small but crucial problems became apparent early on: First, my relationship with highly concentrated alcohol is, to put it mildly, a troubled one. And second, I had made the regrettable mistake of skipping dinner. Thus, fate took its course, and the alcohol hit me faster than I could utter, “One more won’t hurt!”

In high spirits—or, to be more precise, in a state of complete inhibition—I found myself at the club’s smoking area. There, I loudly proclaimed to the entire clientele: “Guys!Tonight, you can pull whatever you want—I AM PLAYING WINGMAN!” My dedication to interpersonal diplomacy remained unshaken, despite my rapidly fading judgment.

What happened next remains shrouded in the fog of amnesia. However, the following day would bring a brutal clarity that would make even a veteran of Saturday nights break into a sweat.

The next evening, as life gradually returned to my body, we once again ventured out. While waiting in line to enter another club, a comrade of mine pointed, with a mischievous grin, at an exceptionally round lady and said: “Pan, that one’s for you.”

Innocent as a lamb, I chuckled and asked, “What do you mean???”

His response drained the color from my face in an instant: “Don’t you remember? The one from last night.”

And then it came—the merciless retelling of my previous night’s escapades, shaking the very foundations of my world. As it turned out, I had engaged in a particularly enthusiastic liaison with a woman of impressive proportions. She was about five times my volume, and together we had danced with great energy. My friend reported that he had spotted me from a great distance—because I had yelled across the entire club:

“BRO, LOOK! I’VE GOT THE MEATIEST ONE IN THE WHOLE CLUB!”

The lady, a remarkable mix of confidence and selective hearing, had apparently not only heard my enthusiasm but also chose to ignore it, continuing to unleash an almost orchestral display with her derrière.

This incident remains a valuable lesson in alcohol, diplomacy, and the perils of an uncalculated wingman career.

Did I learn from that night? Well… that’s a story for another time.","Got drunk on vodka, declared myself the ultimate wingman, blacked out. The next night, friends revealed I had enthusiastically danced with the biggest woman in the club—shouting it across the room. She didn’t mind, but my dignity sure did.

"TIFU by assuming my e-reader broke irreversibly
Some time ago, I (18F) got an e-reader. A nice little thing, Pocketbook 628 Touch Lux 5. Nothing too fancy. It had a nice front light, it read books. It made me enjoy books and I read more than before I got it. Sailing the high seas, it was also much more cost-effective. 

That was until one day. I set it too close to the edge of something and I forgot about it. I went to do something in that area later and... Shit, it fell. I picked it up. It didn't seem to respond. I thought the screen could break and hoped it wouldn't be the case. You know, once the ink in e-ink displays gets out of the capsules, it's dead. So it's much more fragile than normal displays. I waited for a bit, pressed the power button too many times to count and after a while, it finally moved! So, it works now fine, my small mess is not anything big, right? Wrong

Apparently, although the display was fine, something inside, presumably the cable connecting the insides to the display broke, because sometimes it had troubles refreshing. Though pressing on a basically random spot worked. Sometimes. I was disheartened. One day, it wouldn't move anymore at all. I decided to go to a repair shop.

And they repaired it. Pretty cheap, too. However, it seemed to work for a while until the display got stuck in one position again. I tried for a few days to use it but it wouldn't refresh no matter how hard I tried to plug it in, restart it, whatever. I gave up and read on my tablet.

Tomorrow, I am going on a trip from school with a LOT free time in the bus. My mom got the great idea to get a new e-reader, since my tablet is too expensive and unwieldy for that task. I was against the idea at first. I broke the e-reader with my carelessness, what do you mean I can get another one? Well, I was persuaded because I wanted to read and not risk losing or breaking a tablet I use for school, especially since I will have exams soon and it would suck to lose my notes (I responsibly save them to cloud but who knows what might happen?)

The new e-reader in question is Pocketbook 629 Verse. It's practically the same thing as the first one except it now has usb-c, sd card reader and a new design. 

I get a great idea. Wouldn't it be funny if the old e-reader worked if I plugged it in? 

It was a very funny idea because it was true. I now feel even more awful. It's now at around 30% and seems to work just fine. How the hell do I break it to my parents? I feel even worse now. I don't even know if we can return it. Shit.","Thought my e-reader broke, bought a new one. It wasn't that broken.",My e-reader broke and I am going on a trip from school with a lot of free time.

"TIFU by burning desiccant
Last week I got myself a brand new cast iron pot, mainly for baking bread. I seasoned it nicely and used it once for a pot of soup. After washing up I threw in a deccicant bag (those ""do not eat"" bags that keep packages dry) to prevent it from rusting. 

Fast forward go this morning, I was exited to use it to bake a sourdough bread that had proved over night, and I threw the pot in the oven at 250°C and took a quick shower while it was heating up. I come back to the kitchen and open the oven door, and a wall of putrid smoke hit me right in the face. I luckily managed to open the window and door fast enough to not set off the fire alarm. I took the pot out, still confused as to where the smoke came from, and opened it to an even thicker smoke and a puffed up almost black chunk of paper, plastic an desiccant. 

For those wondering, it was a pain in the ass to clean up after. Part of it was a fragile sponge that crumbled into fine powder when I touched it.

"TIFU by accidentally befriending a very niche YouTuber from my childhood
When I (f) was younger and still figuring myself out, I stumbled upon a small YouTuber (f) who did music covers I was entranced by her voice and really looked forward to every video she'd posted, she was a huge part of my Bi awakening.
 I inevitably grew out of her channel and she also stopped posting for a while causing me to more or less forget about her and her music. 
Fast forward 6 ish years and I'm working at a dingy minimum wage restaurant on the boardwalk with a couple of my now close friends, they happened to be pretty close to the workers at another restaurant nearby and we would do trades etc. 
There was this one person who worked at the other restaurant who felt oddly familiar to me but I could never quite put my finger on who she was, I'm sure by this point you can see where this is going, but at the time I did not. anyway by the fate of god, or the devil himself, YouTube randomly recommended me an old video of hers and I decided to watch it for nostalgias sake, still I had yet to puzzle the pieces together. I eventually started following her on her socials and noticed that she had a crap ton of followers and asked my coworker what that's all about, he tells me she use to make music on YouTube and got quite a following on there. I had a that's so raven moment where I finally peiced everything together - apparently so did the universe because despite not watching her videos in literal years I am now consistently getting ""my mix's"" FILLED with her videos, now knowing her in person it makes me feel weird but the YouTube gods seem to find it hilarious, and now to top it all off my best friend is dating her so now it's extra weird.","I had a gay awakening years ago because of a niche YouTube cover artist whose apparently from my city, now she's dating my best friend and the YouTube gods keep making playlists full of her music to make me seem like a creep despite not listening to her in years.","I befriended a YouTuber from my childhood, grew out of her, found her on YouTube, now I'm getting my mix's FILLED with her videos."
"TIFU by getting drunk at a stranger's house party, throwing up from the window and passing out on her couch
I got invited to a house party last night. In retrospect I should have said no, but I was invited by the guy I've been on a few dates with (we'll call him L) and it seemed like a good idea somehow. I didnt know the host but there were a lot of people invited who didn't know her either so I thought that would be ok.

Of course I have terrible social anxiety so I pregamed a bit by myself at home. Just enough to get a comfortable buzz, although I'd had a couple glasses of wine with lunch and mixing wasn't a good idea.

So there were a lot of people at the party, which usually is fine because it means I get to go unnoticed more easily, but L as it turns out is super popular so we spent the night greeting people I had never seen in my life. There was a lot of alcohol and drinking games and I kinda bonded with a few of his friends over playing a few games. We played Would you rather, Truth or dare and Never have I ever and I gleefully did and confessed to some very embarrassing stuff. First FU of the night. I got up on a coffee table and was politely asked to get down (almost fell), gave away some clothes and told stories and things about myself I would have never. Plus, kept drinking.

My next memory is being babysat by L in a bedroom, saying I felt terribly sick but adamantly refusing to go to the bathroom because I didn't want anyone to see me go out like that. He opened the window for some fresh air and minutes later I violently threw up from it. This morning when I left I saw the splatter RIGHT OUT of the entrance, so basically everyone else did and I'm pretty sure they put the pieces together that it was me.

I woke up on the couch, in the living room, no memories in between. The host was pretty sweet, told me L wanted to take me home but she convinced him to let me sleep (which.... WHY!). I apologized endlessly and she said that it was ok. I had to throw up (in the toilet) this time before I left. Didn't even bother to find all of my clothes, there's a couple missing.

I wanna crawl into a ball and never leave my bedroom again.","I got blackout drunk at the house party of a friend of my date's. Publicly did embarrassing stuff, and said even more embarrassing stuff.

Mandatory this was a few days ago.

I was hanging out with some coworkers in our pickup waiting for a call so we could get started.

I was vining, chilling, reading an ebook on my phone.

A bubby from the front seat mentions this riddle. As near as I can remember...

""A man is at a funeral. He sees a beautiful woman crying over the casket. That night he kills her mother. Why did he do that?""

Since I was vibing and only half paying attention I said ""To see her at her mother's funeral.""

"TIFU (or yesterday night) by chipping the tartar off my own teeth with a needle
So I was rampaging after my dentist appointment back in December and was told I have tartar, not too much but visible on the backs of my front four bottom teeth. I didn't do anything about it except excessively brushing and flossing hoping it'd decrease as I'm a minor and my dad can't really afford the outrageous fee on professional tartar removal. I was initially going to leave it as I did for so long, but it barely decreased. Last night I got fed up and took a needle and chipped it off my own teeth. My teeth looked fine but then I noticed my middle right (my right) tooth having a little ridge that dipped downward into the gum.

"TIFU by getting with my friend in the same house as my ex
-Some contex-

My (21F) best friend Barry (25M) also happens to be my ex. We were together for 3 years and broke up amicably in April of 2024 due to me loosing my romantic feelings for him. Since then we have both figured that we work way better as friends. This is something that both of us agree on, although he has admitted that he has a romantic interest in me still. Since our breakup we both don't have plans to date other people, although part of my reason is simply to avoid hurting him.

6 months ago I made a new friend called Yannis (20M), and we have become really close friends, we're actually in a band together now. About 3 months ago we discovered that we share romantic feelings for eachother and on the down-low started to hookup. Yannis is fully aware of my situation with Barry and understood that I didn't want Barry to know about us hooking up because it would simply cause him unnecessary pain. Plus we were just a casual fun thing, just blowing off steam, and I didn't really see any long term potential with him. He wasn't really a great friend at times too and just wasn't what I would want in a partner. 

-end of context-

Last night I threw a birthday party to celebrate my 21st, I invited a few of my friends, including both Barry and Yannis, and after a lot of drinking I was feeling a type of way and brought Yannis to my room to hookup while the party continued outside in my garden. This wasn't my best decision but I guess I was drunk and didn't think anyone would notice us gone for a few minutes. Well halfway through I get a knock on my door and it's Barry, and he wants to come in. I make up some excuse about just feeling overwhelmed and needing a minute to myself and that I would meet him outside but I don't lie often so it was obvious that I was lying. So Barry finds out about me and Yannis hooking up and so we decide to go for a walk to talk about it.
Barry was mainly just asking ""why?"" and after me giving lame excuses, something clicked in me and I told him that I had been in a Bipolar low since December, and this was my way of dealing with it. I wish this was a lie but when I said it I felt a wave of relief of getting it out there. I had been using Yannis as a source of fulfillment between days of numbness. After saying this I knew I wasn't in the head space to keep unloading this cam of worms so I told Barry that I would walk him home and that we should talk about this another day when I am sober and clearheaded. 

Since this all has happened, Barry has said that he needs time to think about everything. I am so worried that I am going to lose my closest and most important friend due to hiding such a major part of my life from him. He feels betrayed that I never felt I could go to him and talk to him about feeling low and instead went and started having sex that wouldn't solve anything. 

At this point I would happily never talk to any of my other friends again if it meant keeping my friendship with Barry but I worry I've damaged too much.","A year ago I (21F) separated with my ex (25M) due to us being better suited as friends, even though he still has feelings for me. Because of this I have avoided romantic relationships with other people to avoid hurting him but recently started hooking up with a friend (20M) on the down-low to deal with a Bipolar low. Last night at my party I hookup up with him and my ex found out about and I broke and told him about how I've been in a low since Christmas. He is now obviously upset due to me hiding a massive part of my life from him and instead deciding to deal with it through  careless sex, which I also hid from him.",My (21F) best friend (25M) is my ex and I hooked up last night.

"TIFU by telling a customer about a brewery
I work for a small company and had a customer who came to use our services. One of my jobs is to act as the receptionist, so I was chatting with this guy (while he waited) about how he just moved to our state and the differences he's noticed. He's not used to the weather, he misses his friends, regular stuff when moving to the other side of the country. It's a small town and he mentioned not knowing anyone in town. I noticed he was wearing a hoodie with a well know metal band and told him about a local brewery that hosts metal shows once a month and it's a fun scene. My roommate and I go all the time and it's a great place to meet new people. All was good and he left.

I just got a call from his daughter who sounded upset as she asked me if I had invited her parents to a bar. I quickly said no, that I was just telling her dad about it since he was a metalhead wanting to meet folks. She asked the name of the place and ended the conversation after I told her. Man, I don't know if this is considered crossing the line and if she was mad about it or not. I don't think I'll get in trouble, but I'm still nervous that something bad may come of this since everything can be taken out of context these days.",I made small talk and told a customer about the local music scene at a brewery and got a seemingly angry call from his daughter.

"TIFU by being intrusively helpful
This happened on thursday. 

For the last couple of weeks I noticed what appeared to be a new kid on our street mostly because he'd run past our house right after the bus for our son's school would leave. I figured he just couldn't get the hang of the timing (being new and all) and would run to catch it at one of the other stops. It happens sometimes, no biggie.

Our district is short on bus drivers, so they alternate which routes end up on a two hour delay for pick up. Thursday was our turn. They sent out the calls and emails alerting us that morning, so my partner took our son to school. I happened to be by our window when the kid and another person ran past our house again. Instantly I went outside and shouted ""it's on a two hour delay!"" I motioned for them to come over, which they did, and first I asked if he was trying to make the bus (even said my son's bus number and school to double check), they said yes. So I explained about the delay and showed them the email.

Turns out the other guy is the boy's father and he asked ""no school for him today?"" I said ""he has school, it's just on a delay, but we can take him in when my fiance gets back."" We went in circles like this for a bit because there was a language barrier and they were understandably confused. (To note: the previous neighbors had it happen before where they didn't know the bus was on a delay since the notice goes out last minute sometimes and we'd offer to take them to school, so I didn't think much of it in the moment.)

Long story short: turns out he doesn't go to my son's school. He was trying to make the city bus, not the school bus, and I made him miss the bus. Once my fiance got home we did make it right by taking him where he needed to be and got him there on time, but man I felt like a goob. What a way to meet your new neighbors.",assumed my new neighbor road my son's bus and unintentionally made him late for his actual bus.,New neighbors didn't know the bus was on a two hour delay and I made him miss the bus.

"TIFU: Letting my cat in the bathroom
(I'm posting on behalf of my husband)

This morning I overheard swearing and shocked ""oh my god""s coming from our RV bathroom. Terrified that some accident occurred, I jumped out of bed and ran to see what was the commotion. 

Apparently our very fluffy, white kitten (who insists on being our bathroom supervisor) had decided she needed to conduct a deeper review that day and had jumped into the RV toilet while my husband was mid stream. 

All hail the piss gremlin. She was *pissed* that we dared wash off her new fragrance.

Just yesterday we researched why some cats demand to be in the bathroom with us and leading research theorizes it's because they view us as vulnerable while using the restroom and endeavor to protect us.

Now I think she's just a lil freak. 

So I guess our little princess loves pork, peanuts and piss. I wouldnt have her any other way.","Our white, fluffy kitten jumped into the toilet while my husband was mid stream. 🥇🚿

"TIFU by commenting on my (f 29) potential gf (f 33) use of salt....🫠
Disclaimer: names & ages have been changed to perserve anonymity. Let's start with a bit of background information. I have been dating Eve for about a month now. I have been exclusively dating her for a few weeks now. Yesterday we had our first night cap after a cute little sushi date. She had it all planned out for me to spend the night so she could make me breakfast. She even remembered my preferred breakfast. In previous conversations Eve has made it very clear she is not the best cook. Even while she was cooking she made comments that let me know she was struggling a bit. Such as ""how do you know when grits are completely cooked?"" ""How thick should grits be?"" Etc. Which in all honesty did raise some concern on my part. So I offered to help more than once. I was denied each time. She said ""I didn't bring you over to cook."" Which was sweet & I appreciate the gesture. Once she was done cooking I took the plate, said thank you & sat down to eat. From the first bite I could tell that it was over salted. Previously we talked about how we are both working on using less salt in our food. So I said & i quote ""Oh you are a bit early on your less salt journey."" 😵‍💫🥴🫣🫠 

Her response ""oh so you are going nit pick everything? You make me not want to cook."" That's when I knew I Fucked Up. 😓","i said ""Oh you are early on your less salt journey."" When my poetiential partner who is a bit insecure about cooking made me breakfast that was over salted. 

 I think I hurt her feelings, because I didn't think it through before speaking. I know I'm the asshole here. I hope I can fix it. I don't want to discourage her. I'd actually like if we cooked together. But I may have ruined any chance of that.","TIFU by commenting on my (f 29) potential gf's (f 33) use of salt....🫠

"TIFU by making a hot sauce
Obligatory, this was about a month ago. At work I was discussing my love of spicy food and a colleague  ended up giving me some of her spiciest chillies. For a week I was cooking them up for myself and loved it. Very hot, but nice. I still had some left over so thought I would wait to serve up something for friends.

Opportunity came when, Greg, Alex, and Will (fake names) coming over for DND, and my wife and I decided to make burritos. I thought ""great, lets whip up these chillies into a special sauce."" I ended up making a lime, mango, and chilli sauce that could be added on and I thought it was amazing. My wife had a taste and said it had a kick She also has a decent spice tolerance. 

Break time comes and burritos are served, I put the sauce out and prefaced, ""it is hot"". Now Greg, who I've known since high school knew I liked spice, and did not trust it.  Alex put a little on the burrito and admitted it was hot. Will is a person who thinks pepper is spicy, and is expanding his palate, so thought he would give spicy a go. My wife did warn him, let him know he would not handle it. So instead of putting it streight on the burrito he had a little taste on his finger and the effect was immediate. Red face, panting, bit of screaming ""what the fuck!"" Everyone then talked about how spicy it was and asked what I made it from. I explained that I got them form someone form work. They asked what the chilli was and I told them I believe they were Carolina reapers and had been eating with them for about a week and through they were great. So the part that I fucked up in was I did not know they were such a deal, AKA hottest chilli in the world.

There is so much wrong with this story. It begins at like 11 o clock at night, and I’m laying in bed scrolling the night away.

He suggests that my brother and I along with another friend from high school sneak out with him and get drunk to help him feel better. I accepted and grabbed my brother from his room and we snuck out. Like any responsible teenagers sneaking out, we stopped by our parents room to listen in and see if they were awake. We heard talking and got spooked. However, the talking quickly escalated into moans, claps, grunts, and other various sex noises. We were disgusted and left the house quickly, throwing caution to the wind. They didn’t notice through their fucking, but we were still incredibly grossed out. Due to this, we drank much more heavily than we originally planned. Too much. Never even made it back home. Ended up sleeping in a driveway. (Not Fred’s)

"TIFU entire class decided to write letters to a prisoner UPDATE
For those who haven't read the first long story, when I was in an IB class in the 1990s, our teacher thought it was a great idea for us to answer an advertisement of a French prisoner in need of someone to correspond to. Our class wrote the man diligently until he sent a letter detailing why he was in prison. Concerned about his situation, we all decided to stop when summer came. The next year, our teacher asked us which one of us told him her address and birthday because she got a card in the mail. We were silent in the face of her accusation, and we all agreed to not contact him again.

Here is the link to the [original](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1j9b4iy/tifu_entire_class_decided_to_write_letters_to_a/)

Now, onto some  updates:

So my coworker and I had a chance to talk today. I asked her if she still had Maxim's letter because I would love to read it again. She laughed and said she does have it somewhere, but she's not certain where. But as we were talking, she did have some things that I need to clarify.

So my memory wasn't what it used to be. She told me it was a French newspaper that we were reading called Francophone that was published in America. I did have the ad right, but he wasn't in Colorado, he was imprisoned in Oregon.

And I knew the letter was long, but it was 8 pages instead of 3. She said when she read the whole saga, she thought one of two things, either he was delusional or it was true. She remembered much of the information that I have already said. So the smuggling, drugs, arrest, all the same. However, she told me that she remembered he told her that before he was arrested, his wife and he were held hostage by a Colombian drug cartel for a year. Somehow he and his wife escaped, though she couldn't remember how that happened. It wasn't until they left the cartel that Maxim was arrested by the American government.

She did have an update on Maxim's current life. He lives in Israel now. She thought it had to do with some extradition laws, but that was a few years ago too.

To be honest, I wrote this post because I don't talk about this much and the telling of my tale would die in an Internet void. I really didn't anticipate all the responses and interest, so thank you.

But at the same time, I hope Maxim is well and doesn't remember our class.

I frantically deleted it from the blackboard but a good 5-6 seconds must have passed. I have no idea if the student saw it (the webcam recording showed that they were looking down at the time) but I checked and it was definitely in the class recording that is going to be accessible to my course coordinator, school admin and the student.

I quickly texted my department head and principal to apologize and to take the recording down. Nobody has called me yet. I sit silently in my chair, anxiously awaiting my demise. I know that I will probably be fired, taken to court, sued for everything I'm worth and quite possibly imprisoned.

"TIFU by ""breaking"" into stranger girls apartment and making a show of puking all over her floor and putting myself in the hospital for it
This happened a couple of weeks ago, I have just now gotten over the shame I feel for what happened. That dreaded weekend. I was invited to a friends birthday party, and both he and I recently turned 21 (legal drinking age is 18 here). I told him I had never truly gotten proper drunk, so we made a pact to be drinking partners. Which i realize now was the bane of that night, since he is the birthday man and bound to drink a lot. The night got off to a good start, and I got six beers deep, having a nice time. Then, for some unholy reason, I decided to chug half a bottle of wine in seconds, breaking my friend and I's pact. That is when my mind stopped thinking of limiting what I drunk, I remember taking shots after shots, making out with my first guy ever, stumbling down the street somehow standing on my legs before being sat down in my friends living room.

So my friend is living in a student apartment, sharing the living room, kitchen, and bathroom with 3 others. A guy, a girl, and an unoccupied room. The bathrooms are in the shared hallway, connected to all the rooms. The kitchen and the living room are in one large room opposite of all the bedrooms.

After being sat down in a seat by the living room, drifting in and out of consciousness. Getting the most delicious chicken nuggets of my life and definitely a few check-ins. I woke up on the floor, directly in the doorway. I remember having this incredible urge to puke, so I weakly got onto my feet, not realizing the others in the room were asking if I'm good. I went out into the hallway, where I made the crucial mistake to turn left, instead of right, to the bathroom. After leaning up against the door, which I thought was the bathroom, feeling my stomach groaning from having one... three... maybe ten too many drinks. I thought it was best to hurry up. Pushing open the door, taking a couple of steps in, I realized this wasn't a bathroom. Instead, it was the girls, my friends flatmates' room. The girl, which I have never talked to, laid shocked in bed, woken up by my drunk ass stumbling in, disturbing her peaceful sleep.

I managed to croak out a pathetic ""Sorry"" turned around, and promptly puked almost all my toxic, stinking stomach contents out on her floor and out into the hallway. Messing up my socks and probably quite a lot of her stuff. I don't remember much of what happened after, other than having a bucket and mop shoved into my hands and doing my best to clean up my mess and throwing my socks in the garbage.

After doing my best to drunkenly clean up everything, I fell asleep on the sofa, sock-less, and still drunk as hell. I woke up with a terrible headache and feeling sick, experiencing my first proper hangover. I stood up and did my best to clean over the mess again with a new mop, despite my drunk self doing a surprisingly good job cleaning. Before heading out, I decided to grab a glass of water, feeling parched. I turned on the sink, blacked out, and woke up on the floor, shaking and hearing my friends voice far away, shouting my name. Two seconds later, I'm in a taxi on my way to the hospital, being deemed a ""non-emergency"" by (the equivalent to) 911. Sitting there, I realized I had wet my pants for the first time since I wore diapers.

After a few days in the hospital they told me they had no idea what happened, probably unfortunate circumstances, so now I have a few months of test ahead of me to find out what other thing is fucked up with me since this had happened before.","I got drunk, got lost on my way to the bathroom and stumbled into his female flatmates room and apologized before puking my guts out, later getting a seizure and being put in the hospital for monitoring.",I broke into a strangers apartment and made a show of puking all over her floor.
"TIFU by flirting with my roommates friend
I never thought I would be posting in this sub Reddit, but here I am I guess.... I feel horrible and disgusted with myself. I been in the most healthiest relationship I ever had in my life for 6 years and I fucked up by flirting with my roommates guy friend. I do have to admit our relationship started to get a little boring, but I still loved him and my roommate had her British friend come to visit her and stay with us. When I met him I had no feelings for him I just thought of him as another person until I started to get to know him I fell hard. Our connection was strong there was strong chemistry and it first started as play arguing and fighting and got worse it just evolved. 
  
When my fiance was gone the friend and I would have deep talks about our lives and we found out how much alike we are and how we think the same way it felt nice to talk to someone who understood me immediately unlike my fiance where it takes weeks for him to see my side of things. My connection with this friend just grew and when he left I felt upset like I lost a part of me and I thought that was the end of that. I said to myself now that he is gone. Maybe this silly little crush will leave too, but it didn't. 
  
The crush just kept growing and I kept ignoring it because I'm in a relationship, but my dumbass decided to text the friend and we were talking. We talked about everything with ease like if we knew each other for years. We talked more about our lives and kinks just everything about each other, but I did the mistake to talk to the friend about my kinks in front of my fiance I thought he was asleep, what lead to the conversation was the friend thinking my roommate and him were going to fuck and I joked how she blue balled him that's how it spiraled into talking about our kinks at the moment it felt right. 
 
 After talking about our kinks it was 3am and we got into our feelings. I confessed to him how I started to have a crush on him and he confessed saying he felt the same and how it felt natural and not forced and it was crazy how we fell for each other only knowing each other for two weeks. The whole time I thought I was being sneaky, but apparently my fiance woke up and was peeking and saw me say I had to confess something to the friend, but looked away feeling guilty that he peaked. 
  
The whole time I didn't know I went to the pickle festival with my friend and my fiance kept messaging me like nothing happened. Until he got home from work. I was asleep and my fiance was in his head about the friend and my roommate asked him if they could go get something to eat since she would sense something was wrong and he agreed. My fiance was still nice and considerate to buy me food too even after I hurt him. When he finally came home I woke up, but was still exhausted and had a headache, but I ate the food that's when he asked me about the text and I acted defensive which is something I don't do. 
  
My fiance asked for permission to look at my phone and messages and I usually say yes, but this time I said no and to respect my privacy which is very unusual from me. He got upset rightfully so and laid down next to me asking me if I was single would I end up dating the friend and my heart sank because I would, but I said I don't know. He asked if I was flirting with him and I lied again saying no. I don't know why I lied. I usually don't, especially with my fiance. We laid for a while and we eventually fell asleep so here we are now. 
  
It's currently 3am and I'm outside in my porch feeling guilty because when I woke up my fiance wasn't holding me he was distant and my phone was touched and away from me making me think he looked at my messages with the friend and now he knows I been lying to him making things worse for me.

"TIFU by getting a Taxi instead of an Uber
I work in the logistics industry in the UK and was staying overnight in a hotel near a major UK airport. My client had asked me to go to another airport on a 06:00 AM flight. I'm one of those, perhaps annoying, people who would rather be 1 hour early than 5 minutes late. So I was in the hotel lobby packed and ready to leave for 03:30AM. The trip up to the airport takes around 10 minutes from that hotel.

I was sat on the sofa near the entrance to the hotel and it was just myself and the front desk agent who were present. I frequent this particular hotel so myself and the front desk agent were having a chat while I was eating a breakfast yogurt. As time was pressing on I went to request an Uber at around 03:45 AM but was presented with a 30 minute wait. I mentioned this to the front desk agent more just to whinge than anything else. But he immediately insisted on calling for an airport taxi as that likely would be much quicker with similar pricing. I accepted his suggestion and he dutifully called and ordered one.

After around 10 minutes or so a Taxi pulled up at the hotel entrance and the front desk agent said ""Ah the taxi is here."" I thanked him and went outside to meet the driver. I confirmed with him the destination was the airport terminal. This was the start of my undoing. He confirmed that was what he had booked so told me to jump in and off we went. The driver and I on the way exchanged pleasantries and within 10 minutes or so we had arrived at the drop off point at the airport terminal.

I then asked the driver if he took card payments or was cash only. He replied that payment was done via the app and everything was already paid. Confused, I then replied to him that I had not in fact booked through an app and the hotel had called and booked for me. Still naively thinking nothing was amiss I then asked if the hotel were just going to send me the bill. My thinking was it would be charged to the hotel to pass on to me as I've experienced elsewhere in the past. The driver turned to look at me with a shocked expression and then asked for my name. I told him and he looked back at his phone screen. After hearing the reply of ""Well that's definitely not you"" and a few more seconds of silence it dawned on us both what must have happened. Another guest had booked the same taxi company going to the same airport terminal for a similar time and they were running late. 

The driver put his head in his hands and really didn't seem to know what to do. Eventually he said that I should pay him £10 cash and he'd go back to the hotel and explain the situation to the actual customer. I paid him and left the taxi. Feeling absolutely awful that I had stolen another guests taxi which they were ultimately billed for.

When I returned to the hotel a few days later I mentioned it to the front desk agent and he confirmed I had indeed taken the wrong taxi as my taxi arrived shortly after and apologised for the confusion as he also thought it was my taxi.

Moral of the story. Check it really is your taxi before getting in. Don't assume. Confirming only the destination may not be sufficient.",- Accidentally stole another hotel guest's paid for taxi which was booked for a similar time with the same destination.,Got a taxi instead of an Uber.

The empty bag of cat food I decided to use as an extra trash bag. I had leftover lunch from yesterday to throw away that was in a Tupperware (cheese tortellini with creamy red sauce, spinach, and Parmesan cheese) that would stink up my trad kitchen trash. 
I then proceeded to change out my cat’s litter box using the same empty bag of cat food as a trash bag for the soiled litter. 
My plan was to take this bag out to the dumpster on my way to work. That’s where I fucked up, bc I completely fucking forgot. 
I left around 8am and at about 11:20am I was sitting at my desk when the thought of the bag being on the ground in the kitchen easy access for my dog to reach crossed my mind along with, “FUCK. I need to get home!”

My dog is extremely food motivated and sadly enjoys eating fresh cat shit from the litter box. 
(It’s such an awful thing to see when I don’t switch on the cycle function for the robolitter box before she sneaks her head in for the “treat”!) 

All this to say, I knew I what would happen when I got home with hopes to just throw the bag away before she noticed but I was too fucking late. 
You know those videos where a baby gets into flour or peanut butter and when the parent comes into the room it’s alllllll over the place and all over the baby? 

That’s exactly what I walked into. 
I just stood there a bit shocked, just looking around unable to move. 
Cat shit and litter all was spread all over the kitchen floor. No solid pasta was found but I did clean up some red sauce that was on the laminate. The empty cat food paper based bag was ripped open as if my dog was dissecting the bag of food and opened it right up 

I see my sweetheart of a pup that made the mess and knew it was really me that fucked up and I just bent down and welcomed her to me with a few strokes of her fur. That’s when I felt the dried shit and wetness on her. I took a sniff and it’s as if she rolled in the soiled litter which she likely did. 

Taking deep breaths and remembering I have the time to pick up the mess i stood up and I did just that and returned to work. Cleaning her of the cat shit will unfortunately have to wait until I return home again.

These incidents are preventable and TIFU by being forgetful. The mess is cleaned up however, now I’m concerned for my dog because of the literal shit and cat litter and day old pasta she ate. 

What will I come home to after work? Will she hold it down and be okay or will she have an upset stomach and vomit the contents she ate and/or have an episode of diarrhea? 😣😩I’ll have to keep you posted.","I left out an empty bag of cat food with leftover pasta and cat litter with the intention of tossing it in the dumpster on my way to work. That never happened and my dog at the contents of the bag and rolled around in the cat shit.


Update: I came home that day and she was behaving normally along with no vomit or diarrhea. It’s been about a month and we are doing well! Clumping litter was digested I guess 🤷🏽‍♀️",I changed out my cat’s bag of food to a trash bag using the same empty bag of cat food as an extra trash bag for the soiled litter.
"TIFU by not considering daylight standard time.
I (25M) had an interview scheduled today for a summer internship. It was supposed to be from 11 am to 12 pm PT.  When I checked online about how to convert PT to MST, it said just add 1 hour. I checked this a week ago.

I prepared for this interview for the past week. I am an international student, so this is one of the few opportunities that we get. It was my first time being called for an interview after applying to at least 100 positions.

Today, I logged in to the interview platform, and it said the meeting had ended. I panicked, checked online, and was made aware of ""Daylight savings time."" What even is this thing anyway? I have only been in the US for less than a year. And I live in a state that does not follow daylight savings.

I sent the company an email apologizing and asking if it is possible to reschedule, but I don't know how well that will go.

I felt absolutely terrible for the first hour. I talked to my parents and friends, and I have calmed down a bit, but I still feel so bad.

TL:DR: TIFU by missing an interview because I forgot about daylight savings time.

Update : They said they'll reschedule it 👍",,I missed an interview because I forgot about daylight savings time.
"TIFU ao tentar ser romântico e quase causar um incêndio no meu prédio
Então, Reddit, hoje eu aprendi que nem toda ideia que parece boa em filme romântico funciona na vida real. E, *quase*, aprendi isso da pior forma possível.

Contexto: Eu (H32) e minha namorada (M29) estamos comemorando nosso aniversário de 2 anos de namoro. Eu queria fazer algo especial, romântico, *inesquecível*. Sou péssimo com presentes e essas coisas mais tradicionais, então decidi criar um ""ambiente"".

Pensei: ""Que tal um jantar à luz de velas, com um *caminho* de velas levando até a mesa?"". Imaginem a cena: ela abre a porta, e tem aquele corredor iluminado, um clima super íntimo, música ambiente... ia ser perfeito!

Comprei umas 50 velas daquelas pequenas, tipo *rechaud*, sabe? Espalhei pelo corredor do meu apartamento, formando um caminho até a mesa de jantar, onde eu tinha preparado um jantarzinho (comida japonesa, porque pedir é mais seguro do que eu cozinhando).

Até aí, tudo lindo. O problema começou quando eu fui *acender* as velas.

Primeiro, que eu não tinha isqueiro. Tive que usar o *fogão*. Já comecei a me sentir um idiota, indo e voltando da cozinha pro corredor, acendendo vela por vela.

Segundo, que eu não percebi que algumas velas estavam *perto demais* de uns papéis que estavam no chão (contas, jornais velhos, essas coisas que a gente acumula).

Terceiro, que eu sou um *gênio* e esqueci uma vela acesa *em cima* de uma pilha de revistas (não me perguntem o porquê).

Resumindo: Quando eu terminei de acender a última vela, e fui buscar a minha namorada na porta, ouvi um ""*crack*"" vindo de dentro do apartamento. Voltei correndo, e... *o corredor estava pegando fogo*.

Sim, amigos. As velas perto dos papéis fizeram o fogo se alastrar *rapidamente*. E a vela em cima da pilha de revistas? Bem, digamos que ela virou uma *tocha olímpica*.

Entrei em pânico. Minha namorada chegou, viu a cena, e começou a gritar. Os vizinhos saíram dos apartamentos, curiosos e assustados.

Conseguimos apagar o fogo com extintores (obrigado, vizinho do 302!) e muita correria. Mas o estrago estava feito: corredor chamuscado, cheiro de fumaça por todo o apartamento, e um jantar romântico que virou um *desastre*.

Minha namorada, depois do susto inicial, começou a rir da situação (ela tem um senso de humor peculiar). Mas eu me sinto um completo *imbecil*.

E agora, Reddit, como eu explico isso pro síndico? E como eu recupero o clima romântico? (Aceito sugestões, *sem* fogo, por favor).

**","** Tentei fazer um jantar romântico com um caminho de velas, quase incendiei meu apartamento, e agora preciso de um bom plano para lidar com o síndico e com a minha namorada (que, surpreendentemente, achou graça da situação).","Eu namorada estava comemorando a luz de velas levando até a mesa, eu não percebi que algumas velas estavam *perto demais* de uns papéis."
"TIFU by not asking more questions before using a tanning bed.
I got a gym membership recently and with it came all of the perks like a tanning booth, hydro-massage, red-light therapy, etc. 

I’ve never tanned in a booth or bed in my life and I’m pretty pale to being with. Any beach trips, I try hard to cover up because of a really bad sunburn I got as a kid. My family has always pushed for me to tan as pretty regularly they comment things like:
 “You look like a vampire.” 
“You seriously lack vitamin D.”
“You could blind someone with those legs.”
“Got a moon burn?”
And just stupid things like that. 

So I did it. I went to the gym, did my normal work out and decided to get a tan. When I asked the front desk rep how long I should go for she looked me up and down and said “I’m not sure. I’ve seen people do 9 minutes.” I then asked if I needed any sun tan lotion, cause again idk how it works. She says “No, you just pop in and press start. I have you for nine minutes.” 

I didn’t question it. I went in as naked as the day I was born and it’s one of the worse things I’ve ever done in my life. I felt great getting out, driving home, but after my shower it felt like my skin was going to slip off. I turned red and felt hot. Mind you I haven’t had a sun burn in a long time. So I took a nap. When I woke up I felt like Stewie from Family Guy when Brian forgot about him in the tanning bed. 

The blisters are unreal but I’ve been keeping to moisturizing and staying hydrated but it hurts insanely bad. All this aloe and cold compresses have me not ever wanting to see a tanning booth or bed or even the sun ever again.",": I used a tanning booth too long and got a massive sunburn. I regret not asking the lady at the gym more questions.

UPDATE: Can barely type. I hurt. Will report back soon😵‍💫

UPDATE: I’m peeling like crazy. I did have to go to urgent care because I got so incredibly sick. Turns out I got sun poisoning. I’m tons better now and have been advised to follow up with my primary care provider for any further skin changes but I will happily never do that again. I did speak with management at my gym regarding the talk I had with the desk girl. They were apologetic and said it would be addressed. Happy to report I made it out with a semi nice tan but the peeling is pretty bad.",Tanned in a tanning bed for the first time in my life.
"TIFU by choosing the bottom bunk
So a friend of mine had a pretty big get together at his house the other night with all our friends invited. Anyone who had a girlfriend could bring their girlfriend along as well. I have a girlfriend and so does one of my friends who is very important to the story. There were a few other couples in the house but only me and this other friend were the only ones who were sexually active with our girlfriends, for various reasons like the duration of the relationship or religious reasons. As the get together goes on my girlfriend and I start getting in the mood. We decide to go off and have sex. So does the other couple. The only room available was the room of the brother of the person whose house it was. This was a problem because we both wanted to have sex and only had one room. Luckily, the brother had bunk beds, so we decided to each use a bunk. I chose the bottom bunk because the person whose room it was slept on the top bunk and I didn’t want to be the one to mess up his bed. That was my mistake because both the friend and his girlfriend are on the bigger side, and in fact when you add their weights you end up with something just north of 500 pounds (227 kg). Another thing about the two of them is that they like it rough. I neglected to think of all this at the time, as my incredibly gorgeous girlfriend was naked in front of me, which is quite distracting. I quickly took all my clothes off and took her to bed. The entire time we were boning, our background noise was the desperate squeaking and groaning of the springs above us as the mattress struggled to support the weight of my two friends and their wild bedroom habits. After twenty minutes, I heard the sound of wood splintering and cracking, and the top bunk collapsed on top of us. The front of the bed fell first, bonking me in the head but giving me time to grab my girlfriend and roll off the bed before the rest of the bed fell through. We collapsed on the floor. I saw the naked forms of my friend and his girlfriend collapse next to us (something I didn’t like seeing). My head hurt like a bitch. The awkward, eyes closed bumbling to find our clothes was also not an enjoyable experience.

TL; DR: My friend and I had sex with our girlfriends in bunk beds and the top bunk fell on top of me.",,My friend and I had sex in bunk beds and the top bunk fell on top of me.
"TIFU: Is my professor doing too much? (I got a zero)
I’m in my 4th year college class (business). Today we had a case study due (15% of my grade). I got it done 4 days in advance, but my best friend was struggling with it and it was nearing the due date. It’s only two pages so I sent her mine for her to reference (Valid right?). ANYWAYS. She accidentally submits my paper without realizing it. We contemplate, do we email the teacher? (she is mind-bogglingly strict) Then we thought that would draw too much attention to it. So maybe she should just submit her copy and hope only the newest one shows up. 40 minutes after the due date, we both get an email saying we are violating academic standards and proceeds to say “I suggest you drop out of this course” ????? It sucks it wasn’t even my fault and I feel like students commonly share their ideas and thoughts with one another. It’s hard to be mad at her obviously it wasn’t her fault. Now I have to survive the rest of the semester knowing my teacher hates me.","Finished my case study early, shared it with my best friend to help her. She accidentally submitted my exact paper.

"TIFU by not listening/paying attention
So, I was at this place the other day, and it hit me pretty hard. These kinds of places just don’t do it for me anymore. They bring back way too many memories.

I remember once staying at a place just like this with a girl. Thought we were having an incredible time. Like, real romantic stuff. I was convinced we were gonna be together forever, you know? Like, no question about it. I thought we were just on the same page. 

Then, out of nowhere, I get a letter from her. It’s not exactly a breakup letter, but it’s definitely not good news. It’s kinda like a... a ""Sorry, not sorry"" kind of thing. Perhaps a John Deere letter, some may call it? (Sorry, English is not my first language.)

I give her a call, trying to figure out what happened, and she starts going on and on about how I never really listened to her. Said I wasn’t really hearing what she was saying.

Honestly though, I wasn’t really paying attention, so I didn’t totally get it. I mean, who could’ve seen this coming? I thought everything was going fine. But, hey, maybe I missed something. I don’t know.

So, yeah. TIFU by not listening. But I’m not too worried about it. I mean, it's not like I’m the problem here. People make mistakes, right? I’m sure she’ll come around eventually.",I called her up and she gave me some crap about me not listening to her enough or something like that.

"TIFU by not checking the basement
(WARNING: this one gets kind of gross.)

I’m writing this about 20 minutes from when it all ended so I’m sorry if it doesn’t make sense. I (21M) am a college student who’s spent the last week and a half home for my school’s spring break. My parents had decided they were going to visit my dad’s parents a few states over for the week, so they figured they could save money on hiring a dogsitter by just letting me watch him for the week while they were gone. 

This sounded just fine to me, since I had a lot of work to do anyway, and if the only responsibility I had was taking care of the dog, how bad could it be? Sure, I’ve never been real close with him, since the rest of the family liked dogs a lot more than I do, so I just let them take care of him for the most part and fight for his affection while sat back. But I had my mom’s instructions for the dog sitters on how to take care of him, so how hard could it be?

For some necessary context, my family is pretty well off, with a reasonably big house and a finished basement. It’s a beautiful place, all blue walls and thick white carpets and gold accents, since my mom is really into interior design, but it’s big and open and mainly used for guests and stuff. There’s also a small room near the back, designed to be a spare bedroom but ended up kind of like an office space. Either way, I didn’t feel the need to go in there.

So, my family goes, and it turns out that spending a week just with you and your dog is actually a great bonding exercise. He kept me accountable, taking us on walks, sitting next to me while I worked. He’s really old, so most of the time he spent sleeping, only occasionally bothering me to go outside. Sometimes he’d whine, but he’s always been really sensitive to noises, so I didn’t really think much of it. I kept an eye on his diet, since he has a sensitive stomach, trying to feed him the right dog food at the right times so his stomach didn’t get too upset. I figured I was getting the hang of this dog stuff, and was excited to tell my family about how much I was enjoying this time together, me and the dog, when they got back in a few hours.

And then I checked the basement.

A huge, ugly, brown lump of dog shit is sitting on this pristine white carpet, in the middle of this beautiful open concept basement room. I stared at it dumbly for a minute. Then I sighed and went to get the cleaning supplies, but before that I glanced in the office area.

PILES and PILES of it. Remember how I was trying to watch his diet so his stomach didn’t get too screwed up? Well, jokes on me, because that just meant all the shit was diverse in appearance. Hard and cold lumps, orangish watery puddles, little shitlets trailing in a line, all on this thick white carpet.

I cleaned it up, but barely. It’s been two hours and I still feel like Lady Macbeth, washing my hands over and over again and still I smell the cleaning chemicals and the shit stink underneath it. I only hope I hid the evidence well. Either way, looks like pet care is not in my future. Time for a long hot shower.",watched my rich parents’ dog for the week.

First of all, I am really sorry for what I did, and I realized my FU as soon as it happened.

So, this happened 30 minutes ago. I (27M) was talking to this girl online after we matched on Tinder and things were going well, I got her instagram pretty quickly and we kept talking there. Today I found out she is a Borderlands fan, and so am I. During the conversation I made the ABSOLUTELY STUPID MISTAKE of saying ""Can I call you Moxxi?"". She got pretty mad and told me I was being judgemental comparing her to a character that is pretty much the sex appeal of the franchise and went to sleep. It goes without saying that my chances are ruined with her. And here I am, venting to strangers on the internet to try to get this out of my head beacuse I am feeling like the worst person in the world and can't talk about this with anyone. It won't happen again but man does it sting to fuck up like this, dating someone is super hard for me and I've managed to throw everything away.","Met a girl online, made a stupid comment comparing her to a sex appeal character, and lost all my chances with her.","TIFU by saying ""Can I call you Moxxi?""."

So today I fucked up. I was scrolling on Facebook and saw an article by the biggest Catholic news site in my country. It was some homophobic bulshit about the pope's comments on gay people and why blessing them was wrong. The comment section was filled with people sharing similar beliefs and I couldn't help myself and jumped into the comment section armed with Bible quotes about love. For context my last name is very rare and recognisable and I left several comments. A few hours later my dad is like hey OP did you comment on this article?, and shows me his phone.  I said yeah.

"TIFU watching porn with my gf
Last night my gf and I were spooning in bed when I unsuccessfully attempted to initiate sex. My gf reminded me that she had to get up early for work the following morning. I got the message and decided to go masturbate in the bathroom. I was back in bed less than 5 minutes later. My gf said she might have fucked me if she knew I was gonna cum that quick. I said I just watched one of the hottest porn videos, hence the instant orgasm. As soon as I was done saying that, I kissed my gf goodnight and switched off the lamp on my side of the bed. At that moment, my gf switched on her lamp and said she was curious about what made this porn video I watched so hot. I shrugged and said the girls were hot. My gf was like ""girls, as in, girl on girl or two girls sharing one guy?"" I said two girls sharing one guy. My gf said she wanted me to show her the video. 

I switched on my lamp and asked my gf if she wanted us to start watching porn together. She said she just wanted to see what specifically gave me an ""instant orgasm."" I was too fucking dense to sense the potential danger I was in, hence my enthusiasm when I showed my gf my porn. I thought she wanted to get kinky. The video was 45 minutes long. My gf made us watch the whole thing, which took longer than 45 minutes because she repeatedly paused the video to comment. The ""story"" involved a girl encouraging her best friend to sleep with her bf, which ends up becoming a threesome. Cue the first pause. My gf wanted to understand if I imagined myself being the bf who's being shared by his gf. I said it was not that deep. I didn't imagine myself as anyone. A couple of minutes later, paused number 2. My gf said the girls looked nothing like her. I said that was a good thing. 

One of the girls proceeded to eat the guy's ass while the other girl was sucking dick. Another pause. My gf literally pointed her finger at the girl's face in the guy's ass and asked if I wished she was doing stuff like that to me. I said it might be nice. My gf looked at me like that was never gonna happen. Cut to both girls taking turns having anal sex. Cue next pause. My gf said I should speak now if her vagina was not enough. I said her vagina was more than enough. She encouraged me to think carefully about what I just said because based on the porn I was watching, I required more than one vagina to get an ""instant orgasm."" I said I was a one vagina guy, including the exclusion of butt stuff. My gf continued watching before pointing out that one of the girls had a gap in her teeth just like her sister. She eventually paused the video and said the girl with the gap actually looked a lot like a sister.

I said I didn't see the resemblance. My gf narrowed her eyes at me like ""really bro."" I reminded her that she had to get up early for work, which prompted her to watch the rest of the video without pausing every fucking minute. The comments and the questions kept coming. By the time we made it to the end of the video, I was convinced I fucked up because my gf nodded without saying anything. This morning before she left for work, she informed me that she sent a link to the porn video to her sister, and apparently her sister's response was ""ugh... she does look like me!"" All I could do was sigh.

"TIFU by going to work
Well, I'm not sure where else to post this, but given the comedic nature of my misfortune, I feel like someone needs to find some humor in it. It is spring where I live, the weather has been mild and comfortable... Until today. 

This morning I woke up to find it was snowing hard. Now I don't drive so I unfortunately have to walk in these weather conditions. I'm very careful to dress for the elements and prepare accordingly but this morning the elements were not on my side. The snow on the ground was very wet, slushy snow and so the ground was a little slick. I was walking carefully to get to the bus stop to get to work and I'm sure you can guess what came next.

I slipped.

Landed on my side in a slush puddle. Now picture this. I'm already not thrilled about the weather conditions, have just slipped and fell bruising my hip and possibly pulling my hamstring (it certainly feels this way) and I am sitting on the ground defeated and half of me is soaking wet from the puddle I landed in. Well, what proceeds to happen? A big garbage truck drives by spraying a bunch more slush onto my already dejected and overwhelmed and I go from slightly soaked to absolutely drenched.

It's been a few hours and now I am finding it funny, but at the time I was devastated and had to call work crying to tell them I would be late because I had to go home and change my clothes, wash my face and change over my backpack and jacket to something that wasn't dripping with muddy snow.

As I was getting ready for work, for the second time today, all I could think was how I should've stayed in bed.","I slipped in the snow on my way to work in an incredibly comedic sense of misfortune, getting mildly injured and soaking wet and ending up late for work, but it's funny now so feel free to laugh at me.",I slipped and fell in a slush puddle and had to call work crying because I was late.
"TIFU by being on time to lunch
I’m a PhD student and last week my boss sent me an email with an invite to a lunch to meet a faculty candidate and told me he thinks it would be good if i could make it. Sweet- free lunch, so I rsvp using the link on the outlook invite. 

Fast forward to today when I head to the lunch. The invite says lunch starts at 12 so I head over and up up getting there at about 12:02. The conference/lunch room door is ajar and there’s already the candidate (I’ve already met her at this point earlier that day) and a faculty member in the room. The door is open and my PI told me not many people would be coming so I go in and introduce myself to the faculty member. She asks if I have any questions for the candidate, odd but I ask her about her research, etc. 

This goes on for about 10 minutes when our program director walks in and asks what i’m doing here.  im like oh im just here for the lunch. and she responds with 

“lunch hasn’t started yet. this is the interview”

Apparently, the outlook event that i was sent was the wrong time. Lunch started at 12:15 not 12 (on the original email I never saw because i was just sent the outlook event by my PI) I had literally walked in on the interview and just started asking the candidate questions. also, talking with the faulty members students, she was literally just as confused as i was.",i accidentally walked in on a faulty interview and started asking interview questions because i was given the wrong time for lunch,I was on time to lunch and walked in on the interview.
"TIFU by implying that my family owned my doctor’s family and sounding super racist
I know it sounds stupid, but I forget sometimes that most people are the same race as their relatives. I am white but my father, who adopted me, is black. (My biological father died when I was three.) I have a white sibling and a black sibling. My white sister has a black son.

I went to a new gynecologist today and my new doctor is Black. Her last name is my mother’s maiden name, which is not a common name.

I’m chatty when I’m nervous and this was only my second time seeing a gynecologist, so I told her she has the same last name as my mom and asked my doctor where she’s from. She said the name of the same relatively small city in Alabama where my (white) mother is from.

I said, “What? No way! My mom from there! We must be related somehow!”

She just kind of paused for a minute and looked at me like she was trying to figure out if I was joking, and she finally said, “Did your mother’s family own a plantation?”

I said not to my knowledge and I certainly hope not, and suddenly realized that this was the implication in me— a white person— telling a black person that we must be related, through my white family. I just genuinely had not in the moment been considering that “we must be related” isn’t an okay thing to say in that context.

So while she was doing my Pap smear I was apologizing profusely trying to explain that I don’t think of race and family the way most people do because my dad is black, and she said, “but it’s your mom who you thought I might be related to, right?” and I realized I was not going to dig myself out of this hole and I probably really upset her and also probably sounded like I was tokenizing my dad.

She was professional and it didn’t affect my treatment but I feel like I came across as the most racist asshole ever and now never want to go to the doctor again.","I’m white, my black doctor has the same last name as my mother and is from the same city, and I said we must be related.

"TIFU my relationship and learnt that procrastination is the devil and all I do is self sabotage
TIFU my relationship with a boy I loved. This is the first guy I’ve been intimate with and I share a really deep bond with him. This was also the longest talking stage I’ve ever had and it was a big deal to me as I don’t have a lot of experience with guys. We were in the talking stage for 5 months now and he was genuinely one of the most inspiring people I’ve ever met in my life. He is the strongest and smartest person I know and is someone I look up to. But I fucked up real bad. This is a lesson to anyone reading that communication, as hard as it can be sometimes, its the answer to everything

When our relationship started it honestly overwhelmed me as I’ve never felt love like that in my life. But I didn’t say anything. When I would have doubts, I wouldn’t say anything. If I was feeling uneasy, I wouldn’t say anything. I bottled up my emotions. And the most evil thing I did was that I acted like everything was fine. He had no clue that I felt this way. I was procrastinating telling him all of this. I just thought it was a phase I was going through, as that is how I usually feel when I meet new people. It takes me a long time to build connection, but I didn’t communicate that clearly with him.

the guilt I had for feeling that way was eating me up inside. He kind of hinted to asking me to be committed to each other in February, but I would always tell him that I needed more time. And I think I did feel like that in those moments. But its stupid because I was also wondering why this wasn’t happening yet, lol but I was to nervous to give him hints. I’ve been giving him mixed signals throughout our time together and I didn’t realize. 

I felt so much shame and guilt for having these doubts, and it came to a point where I just thought about breaking it off with him. I told all of my friends that I wanted to do that and I felt horrible. In those moments I just thought it wasn’t going to work out with him and it made me upset. 

A few days later me and him were just talking in bed and the topic of us being committed came up, and he told me that he already mentally moved on from us being together as I was giving him hella mixed signals. I didn’t mean to, I lacked self awareness in that department. Also I had a stupid belief that the man in a relationship had to ask a girl out, but why would he do that if he didn’t know what was going through my mind? Anyways him pulling back made me realize how much he ment to me and how much I wanted to be with him.

so I called him later and told him how I felt. I regret not telling him this in person as I didn’t clock how painful it would be for him to hear the words that came out of my mouth. I told him that I had moments where I didn’t feel connected to him and I would feel uneasy. I also told him that I still wanted to be with him though. I broke his heart and he was never the same after this. He said he feels like I took him for granted, which is valid. I was. I couldn’t recognize how much he ment to me until he finally left and I hate myself for it. But he also still wanted to give me a second chance, and I didn’t understand why.

After this talk on the phone, it was never the same between us. I could feel him pulling back more and more and It would kill me inside. I once again was having trouble explaining how I felt. I would freeze up and just start crying (embarrassing ik). We saw eachother one last time and he had a different look in his eye, that’s how I knew it really was over. I went home and received a text last night where he wrote that he was falling out of love with me, and that he can’t trust me after our talk on the phone. Tbh this crushed me but I deserve it lol my behaviour is unacceptable. I don’t know why he stayed with me for so long and I regret not trying harder to communicate with him. I think he cut contact with me as he hasn’t sent me a text since then. I haven’t texted him since last night I think he just needs some space and time away from me.

Though this time period i started going to therapy and found out I am indeed mentally ill. A very hard pill to swallow for me. I have a depression disorder, anxiety disorder and avpd. Now that I’m more informed of my conditions, I realized they hold a lot of control over me. I let my thoughts control me into sabotaging my relationship. I feel like a monster

So just an fyi, learn how to love yourself before getting into a relationship, hard expectation as relationships are kind of just thrown into your life but self love and self care js important otherwise. Stop procrastinating on telling people how you feel. Even though it’s scary. I still have a lot of work to do on myself and I think this relationship made me recognize that. (I need to learn how to take my own advice, easier said than done I guess)",I self sabotaged my “relationship” by putting off talking about my feelings. Now he wants nothing to do with me.,I procrastinated telling my boyfriend about my doubts and I fucked up.
"TIFU by eating before my endoscopy
Yes, you read that right. Please God spare me all the reasons that was wrong and how I could have aspirated, died, etc. It was not on purpose. I'm just an idiot with untreated adhd that leaves me with the memory of a goldfish. 
I woke up this morning (day of my procedure) and totally forgot i wasnt supposed to eat after midnight. I got up early, made a healthy balanced breakfast of bacon and eggs, showered, etc. and made it on time. All of which are impossible on a normal day with my adhd so I was extra confident and impressed with myself. 
I get to the surgical center on time, through registration, to the bed, through vitals, gown up, touch base with the dr's. etc. Nothing out of the ordinary.... until I'm brought back. We get into the procedure room where they're setting everything up (nasal cannula, iv propf, etc) when it hits me like a TON OF BRICKS: HOLY CRAP I DID EAT BREAKFAST THIS MORNING! 
At this point things are moving, FAST.  I'm on my side, there's some kind of gaurd in my mouth, and the medication is kicking in. I'm too embarrassed and ashamed to say anything, so i lie down and let it happen figuring if i don't wake up, i will have deserved it for being so stupid. 
Spoiler alert: I am alive but unwell.  The pain in my stomach is punishment enough. Any doctors out there to tell me wth this is?😫",TIFU by eating breakfast the day of my endo (I forgot to not eat after midnight) and now my karma/adhd tax is terrible stomach pains.,EAT BREAKFAST THIS MORNING!

TIFU by double dosing my ADHD meds

I’ve had a hectic few days as I had to fly back home for a doctors appointment and then fly back to uni the next day whilst preparing for an oral exam for today.

I take 20mg of Medikinet R*t*rd (which is a methylphenidate, and yes that’s really what it’s called (it’s an extended release one)) as I only just started taking meds in December. I was on 10 mg the first few weeks and then increased my dose, this is where my fuck up comes in, so I still had 10mg pills left. I finished the last of the 10mg pills yesterday, but this morning I woke up early to try to get some time to practice for my oral exam and I’m grogginess I took two 20mg pills, aka 40mg. The maximum dose is 60mg.

I’m supposed to leave in an hour and I haven’t even practiced yet I’ve been stressing so hard. I know 20mg isn’t a very high dose (19F 65kg), however it’s been great for me so far. The first week I was on 10mg I even had to step out of class as my head rate was going crazy and I felt like I was going to die. I didn’t die and just took a few days break and went back on it and was fine. 

I might die today though. My oral exam is in SWEDISH, because for some reason I thought  could be cool and learn a new language. I can’t. I speak Spanish and French fluently, so I thought a new language would be a breeze. I was so wrong. And now I’m going to have a heart attack in front of my entire class whilst failing to speak basic Swedish.",I took 40mg Medikinet instead of 20mg on a day I have an oral exam and I am terrified for how this is going to go.,I took 20mg of medikinet R*t*rd and I’m going to have a heart attack in front of my entire class.
"TIFU by reading a label wrong and destroying my health
This last week I’ve been trying to get healthier and change my habits since lately I’ve been putting on weight and not feeling very well, so I figured some changes were in order. I quit alcohol and weed cold turkey and ever since then I’ve been craving something relaxing in the evening after a long day, so I went to my local vegan supermarket to try to find something that might help. In the supplement section I found this stuff called “calm”, a magnesium supplement that helps you sleep and apparently is relaxing, sounds good right? Well it would be if I wasn’t such a fucking idiot. The first night I mixed it up with some water, and it fizzed quite a bit but it was pretty tasty and went down easy, and was actually quite relaxing. The next morning I woke up and didn’t exactly feel the greatest, but figured it was just poor sleep from quitting weed, UNTIL I had some breakfast and things started to go downhill FAST. Massive diarrhea. Uncontrollable and demonic, just absolutely wracked me all day. You might think this is where I started to realize my mistake, but you would be wrong. I figured it was just me being lactose intolerant, and chalked it up to a bad diet. Second day rolls around, same thing, except now I’m nauseas and lethargic, waking up feeling like I’m hungover, and it’s hard to think. Lifting my tools at work isn’t the easiest either, but again I just chalk it up to poor sleep from quitting weed so suddenly. Day three I start it mix it together, and decide to read the label a little closer since I notice I’m using it up pretty quickly. The realization hits. You’re supposed to start with half a TEAspoon and work your way up to 2 TEAspoons over time, I had immediately started with 2 TABLEspoons since I hastily read the label the first night. Looks like I’ll be skipping this the next week or so so I can flush all this magnesium out of my system.",thought it said tablespoons instead of teaspoons and ended up consuming 3 GRAMS of magnesium in one weekend,Read the label wrong and you’ll have a bad time.
"TIFU by using Pavlov's Method with monkey videos
It all started a few days ago (I don't remember how many lmao) when I had this wonderful idea of trying to calm down every time I had any kind of intense emotion by watching videos of different types of monkeys doing random things with the song ""sh-boom"" by The Chords in the background, little by little it started working, every time I got really excited I had those videos repeating in my mind, calming me down when I talk too much because I get too excited, it was funny at first but there have been at least three times that I have cried in despair and those fucking videos won't leave my head and won't stop, it's like looking for a tutorial to make RPC to someone and a two-minute long ad appears",TIFU by trying the Pavlov method with funny ass videos of monkeys with Sh-boom as background music,Pavlov's Method with monkey videos
"TIFU I thought she was taking me to hook up. I was wrong
So this happened back in college at some random house party. I was drinking, vibing, just having a good time when I met this girl. We clicked right away—lots of laughing, some light flirting, and, well, more drinking. At some point, we were standing really close, and she kept touching my arm when she talked. My drunk brain was sure I knew where this was going.

Then she grabs my hand, leans in, and says, “Come with me.”

Obviously, I follow.

She leads me through the crowded house, down a hallway, and into some dark bedroom. She shuts the door, locks it, and turns to face me. At this point, my heart’s racing. I’m thinking, alright, it’s happening.

Then she pulls something from her pocket and holds it up. A deck of cards.

“You know how to play Spades?”

I did not.

I kinda just stood there for a second, my brain short-circuiting. I mumbled something about needing to find my friends and left the room. Still not sure if I missed out on the best Spades game ever or if I just completely misread the situation.

Never saw her again.",Thought I was getting lucky. Turns out she just wanted to play Spades.,"I thought a girl was taking me to a party, but she showed me how to play Spades."
"TIFU by sending an ill-timed gif to the work group chat
Actually back in 2020 when lockdown began, 30M at the time. My workplace shifted to remote working, so everyone was now working from home, and Microsoft Teams was the new tool we were all using to keep in contact. 

My manager suggested that in the mornings everyone sends a GIF or meme to the group chat when they start work, so everyone knows we’re online. The group chat consisted of about 15 people, so mornings were a little annoying as the group chat was flooded with images and messages. As a fan of the Simpsons, I would usually just send some random Simpsons GIF, like Homer emerging from the bushes, Ralph rolling down a hill etc.

So one morning I had to start a little earlier to catch up on some work. I opened Teams, did my usual Simpsons related search and then picked the GIF of “Evil Homer” dressed as the devil, shaking maracas, and dancing on the grave of “Good Homer”. I was the first to message the group that morning, or so I thought…

After I sent the message I went to the bathroom. While on the toilet I could hear my Teams notifications go off, and even heard someone try to call twice, but I figured it could wait until I got back to my desk. 

So I get back to see what was going on a couple of minutes later. The group chat was still open, with my GIF of Evil Homer dancing on a grave, but there was another message I hadn’t seen earlier. The message had the same timestamp as mine, but appeared in the chat before my GIF. They must have sent it moments before I did, making it look like I had sent my gif of the grave-dancing Evil Homer as a response. 

The message was one of the team members saying that her dad had died over the weekend, and she wouldn’t be working for the next few days to spend time with the family and plan the funeral. 

When I realised what it looked like my heart sank. I rushed to delete the message, and just prayed that she hadn’t seen it. The other notifications was one colleague sending me the screenshot of the chat and “WTF”, and the others were two missed calls from my manager and an all caps message telling me to delete the GIF immediately. 

After deleting it I called my manager to let her know what had happened, and thankfully she assumed it was a mistake and I would never do something so insensitive. I asked if she thought I should say anything to the colleague, since I wasn’t sure if she had actually seen it. My manager said she was offline now anyway, so all I could do was wait until she’s back if I was going to say anything.

When she returned to work I did explain what happened and gave an apology.  I didn’t give the full description of exactly what GIF I sent, just that it wasn’t appropriate for the time. Luckily she said she hadn’t seen anything. So thankfully I hadn’t hurt her, but I did scare the hell out of about 5 coworkers who had seen the message and gif before I was able to delete it.",I sent a gif of Homer Simpson dressed as the devil and dancing on a grave immediately after a colleague told everyone their dad had died.,TIFU by sending an ill-timed gif to the work group chat.
"TIFU by wearing two different pairs of shoes
I didn't realize when I was trying to run out the door this morning that I put on two different pairs of shoes. I just happened to look down while I'm waiting for my car and noticed it. Maybe if I had been paying a little more attention. But, how does this even happen? I don't even remember having the shoes in an incorrect order. I always take them off and pair them together so that they're ready for the next day. 

It's probably bad to wear different pairs of shoes, right? I've heard it's bad, but I can't either confirm or deny this claim. It's not even the first time this happens. Last time it was because the shoes looked too similarly to each other. These are not even the same color and I still goofed.

Moral of the story, I guess, is to get enough sleep. And maybe pay more attention when getting dressed.",TIFU by wearing two different pairs of shoes.,I put on two different pairs of shoes and it's not even the first time this happens.
TIFU by fiddling with my computer's kernel and grub (the backbone of the firmware) to make my laptop faster and getting the whole Linux Arch Desktop installing experience.,"Rendered my pc unusable by changing the backbone of the computer to make my lapotp faster. Now I have to reinstall my Operating System and the backup's probably faulty.

Let me take you on a journey that spans pver 10 hours. There was everything one could thought of when interacting cluessly with the Linux system. Dismay, confusion, resignation, hope, frustration and short blinks of happiness. 

It all started when I wanted to make my pc faster so Terraria couldn't lag for me. Ever so helpful, an AI search engine shows me many ways on how to turn my machine into a beast. I had some experience with computers as I am a masochist and use Linux (the first ever attempt at installing was equally catastrophic - I was using an old USB and didn't backup. Idiots have to learn somehow) I believed I could give myself some confidence and fiddle in the backbone of the OS. 
That's when the computer refused to boot up. 
Honestly, it could have been so simple but I thought the problem was in the grub or the BIOS. So I fiddled further into the jungle and corrupted even that.
Now, for those unaware, BIOS is practically the plan E for when your computer refuses to do shit. So now I had a unusable monitor with a keyboard on my table. At least it looked slick.
The only way to get it back for me was to download the correct BIOS on another pc and with a USB, get it into the bricked laptop. The only available notebook was of my father's, and already stressed from destroying my notebook, I clinched my ass and my heart-rate spiked anytime my dad's pc decoded to *take it slow* (it's probably just as old as me). I swear the last time I had this much stress was when my life was in danger, but to be honest it probably was just as dangerous to use dad's pc without his allowance and with the possibility of rendering it dead just like my notebook. 
I thankfully got the BIOS without any issues (not bricking the laptop, fascinatingly I have complicated it for me regardless) onto my laptop and done some reinstalling.

I deleted my drivers and gdm3 (the fucking interface), turned down my NetworkManager and emptied some configuration files.
It still fascinates me how I did that. For clarification, I used Perplexity AI as it could search the web and help. But I think it somehow forgot it's purpose in the convo and thought we are doing it like the Arch Linux users (basically making an OS by yourself) and was guiding me through a complete reinstallation (I even got to install AND drivers for my Linux graphics card.)
So I was pointlessly fiddling in the DNS and Network settings becuase I just didn't know how to save a file in Nano.
After around 11 and a half hours I decided to completely reinstall. However, thanks to my mistake of not back-uping my Windows all that while back I had my Flash Drive with some info. 
I am now going to set up my system (ZorinOS, even with all this experience I am not going to touch Windows (and probably even grass)) and hope my USB with the backup files doesn't decide it could be hilarious to do something wonky.
One could call it a happy ending but 11 stressful hours makes one really appreciate a just-barely working machine. 
Aaaaaand the backup service is telling me some files just don't make sense. Guess the journey still doesn't end.

Thanks for reading my partial vent. It's actually kinda relieving typing it somewhere.",TIFU by fiddling with the kernel and grub.
"TIFU by asking my husband to pick up the kids
TIFU and just hilariously embarrassed myself and the poor older women at the ticket counter.
I went to the box office to get tickets for an event. Before I walked in I text my husband and asked if he could pick up the kids because I was running behind. I got to the counter and told the very nice lady (in her probably late 60's early 70's) what I needed. We went over seating charts and dates and had been talking for quite some time so now we're basically friends. I also had a coupon code on my phone and showed it to her. She wasn't familiar with it and needed to check with her supervisor and asked to take my phone. No problem. Gave her my phone and she went back to check. After about 5ish minutes She came back super uncomfortable, said she was able to process my coupon, handed me my phone and said ""here you go, you got a text"". And would no longer look me in the eyes like she previously had been during our whole interaction. Thought it was odd, but paid for my tickets and went on my way. 
I looked at my phone and saw my husband had text me back and said ""well I just sat down to shit but I'll pinch her off and run and grab um"" I started laughing hysterically and passed by a hockey team coming in to practice and they all looked at me like I was unwell which made me laugh even harder. 
Hopefully you all can laugh with me. If not and this is just dumb you can let me know that too because it'll also make me laugh.","I Asked my husband to pick up the kids so I could get tickets to an event, he sent back that he just sat down to poop but would pinch it off, the poor older women at the counter saw the text before I did and became super uncomfortable when handing my phone back to me.",TIFU by asking my husband to pick up the kids at the ticket counter and got a text from a nice old lady.
"TIFU by acidentally making an innapropriate joke
i (15, M at the time) was at the airport a few years back getting on a plane to go to disney world, we had driven to the airport and went through security just like anyone would. UNTIL we got to the X-ray machine and of course i had to empty my pockets and put the items in a bin as usual. that day i was wearing jeans (this is important in a second) so i walked through the machine but it made a noise, indicating there was something metal on me. maybe it was a coin i couldnt find in my pockets but when i tried to go through again, it made the same noise, so i had to be searched by one of the security guards (who was a woman) with one of those metal detecting wands. when she couldnt find anything, she asked ""do you have anything that might be metal on you?"" now keep in mind, i was wearing jeans, and i instantly thought of my zipper being metal, so of course i told her. at the time, i didnt understand anything wrong that i had said, but when i was on the plane, i had realized what i had said, and it definantly came off as innapropriate.",i acidentally told an innapropriate comment  about my zipper at an air port when asked if i had anything metal on me,accidentally made an innapropriate joke about my zipper.
"TIFU by sending money to my ex-gf instead of my former boss and getting fired for it
So I just got let go by my company because I accidentally Zelle’s my ex girlfriend money instead of my former manager. 

Let me just start by saying that unfortunately, my ex and former manager have the same first name. My former boss got married mid year and now hyphens her last name with her husband’s last name. So now both my ex and my former boss’s initials and even last names are fairly similar.

About 2 months ago, my former manager invited us to dinner since our corporate office moved to a different state. She wanted to have the team together for an informal Holiday dinner. She chose the city I live in because there’s more options and can go out afterwards. I was near the corporate office but decided to drive 2 hours to just go home for Saturday night. I was still checked in the hotel and realized that I could be back by Sunday to get ready to work that Monday.

So we had dinner and my former manager told the team that she was going to leave the company. She asked us all if we wanted to go with her and create the department like we did in our current company. About 5 of my 8 colleagues immediately showed interest and started went on to get interviews the following week. I was very hesitant for personal reasons. She really wanted me to be a part of the new team as I was the second-most experienced person in her team. 

At the end of the night, I jokingly told her that I appreciated the TBD (Team Building Dinner). However, I felt it only fair to pay for my portion with my per diem. Not going to lie, I was a little bit drunk and distracted when I was trying to Zelle her money. So I did it quickly and then didn’t think about it for the rest of the night.

So my manager resigned and took half the team with her. Our department was in disarray and the higher ups were very upset. They asked me if I was part of the dinner and discussion about leaving the company. I lied and told them that I knew nothing about it or the dinner the team had.

A few weeks ago, my former manager called me and asked me to reconsider. She even told me that she would forgive me for not paying my portion so long as I scheduled an interview with her new company (she was just joking of course). I told her that I did pay her and went through my account. That’s when I realized my mistake. I told her that I would think about it when I return from my vacation. 

2 weeks ago, I was on Holiday and went back to my home country. This Monday that I returned, I noticed that my direct reports made a lot of mistakes while I was gone. I had a meeting with them to discuss the importance of paying attention to small details. In the meeting, I mentioned what happened with my ex and former manager, how I had made a mistake , and how I had to tuck my tail between my legs and message my ex about my mistake. 

Unbeknownst to me, the director of my department was in that meeting. He called me immediately after the meeting and started questioning me about the dinner. I confessed but told him that I was there but was not really considering the move. Today, I was scheduled for a meeting with HR were I was let go for lying about company resources. That since they were still paying for a Hotel, I went home for the night instead of checking out for the evening.","I sent my ex money through Zelle instead of my manager who quit and took most of the team with her. The company was upset that most of my team left and asked me if I knew anything about it, and I told them no. I used my blunder as an example of the importance of paying attention to detail whilst my director heard. They realized I lied and fired me for it.",I accidentally Zelle’s my ex-gf and got fired for it.
"TIFU trying to include myself in a conversation about eminem (my favourite musician)

for me, it seems like life is constant isolation and humiliation living with autism. I am chronically unable to 'get' social situations or even people in general, and I suspect I give off some autism vibe that people can just feel and avoid me with. there is not 'OMG le I am autism!!!!'. I don't even feel close to others who suffer with this condition, and like many people find others like myself (people truly autistic, including men not just women) as insufferable as I suspect people find me.

For example, the other day I was given a rare invitation to a close and intimate party at a work acquaintance's home. I LOVE being included by people in things even though I don't really get invited to things often, and I despise loud music, dancing etc, so I was really excited for this opportunity to make new friends who perhaps meet consistently at each others places for a cosy night talking and laughing about the world.

When I arrived I was my usual awkward self, and as more people arrived I could feel myself goofing up even more- but surprisingly everyone was kind and not quick to dismiss me. I felt I was actually being given a chance, and like magic I think people began to enjoy my participation in the conversations.

Eventually, the conversations turns to music, and specifically eminem. I am a big fan of eminem, and he literally saved my life so I was really enthusiastic about people's thoughts on his music, so much so that someone even asked me my favourite eminem lyrics. I then rapped the opening to 'insane', which goes like this;

    I was born with a dick in my brain, yeah, fucked in the head
    My stepfather said that I sucked in the bed
    'Til one night he snuck in and said
    ""We're going out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed""

As a survivior of SA, the lyrics to this song have spoken to me really closely, but the look on the faces of my new friends was abject horror. I tried to explain myself but before I could even finish my colleagues wife said that it's time I left the party. 

I dont understand it personally.

"TIFU by pretending to cheat on my boyfriend so that we could break up.
i asked AITAH regarding this story and got like a hundred comments attacking me lol, so clearly im in the wrong. basically, ive been with my boyfriend for a while now, quite a few months, and it began to go weird. he just became dry and made less of an effort to talk or spend time with me, and whenever i tried to bring it up he would say im just overreacting or change the subject. i wanted to breakup, and if im being so honest i wanted to hurt him too. i was hurt myself at how he was acting. so i sent a picture of myself on another guys lap (this guy is my family friend), and my boyfriend called me immediately to ask wtf was going on. then i told him i want to break up, and i hung up.

"TIFU by falling for a fake job scam
I actually fell for a fake job gig. I graduated a year early in college just to be forced to work an unrelated job for over a yr. I was so fed up and felt like i wasted the year i earned. I started applying everywhere in my field again and finally got a call back as a Work From Home Customer Service Agent. I was trying to do IT so this was a step in that direction. 

After interviewing they took all my information and said I would be training during a 2 month probationary period and be paid in the end. 

They actually assigned me daily work over the course of a month and I was “supposed to be paid“ after my six weeks were up. But weird things started happening.

First, I got a call from a random lady from Texas, claiming I friended her on Zelle. Then I got an email a couple weeks later saying my banking information was successfully transferred to a new financial institution, which I never approved or attempted. And finally someone claiming to be with the FBI called me saying I’m under investigation for stealing $3000 from someone’s bank account. He was not an FBI agent. At this point i called my bank to report potential fraud. That email and “FBI” call both happened within 30 minutes. 

All in all, just in case the money was real I sort of did the work but didn’t expect much. I locked my account so nothing can be taken, but money can be added. 

I was wholeheartedly impressed by the scam I fell for so I wasn’t even mad. I usually play along with scams just to fuck with them but this was some next level shit lmao. 

The website they used and everything was falsified to look so real, with references and all. 

So, what did I do?  I added that to my resume as two months of experience in the field adding all the shit that’d look good for my actual career, even though that was a lie. Shortly after that, I got an actual job in IT finally. They were unable to actually call the job but could check the website for “verification” lol. I even gave myself a nice recommendation letter from my boss. 

So technically, I lied on my resume, but did I really?

"TIFU by trying to cook at home more
I've put on some weight lately due to stress eating. I've been eating a lot of junk food and takeout and I told myself today I would try and cook more at home, even though I hate, hate, HATE cooking. For breakfast I was going to have scrambled eggs, some fruit, some Greek yogurt, and 2 strips of turkey bacon.

I had the bacon cooking from nearly raw and all was fine, then I turned my back for what felt like only 2 minutes and the bacon and had burnt, smoking up my apartment and setting off the smoke alarm. Sooo, I trashed it and ate the rest of my breakfast with less protein.

Lunch came around, I'd just come back from an elliptical workout at the gym and I'd planned on having a brown rice bowl with ground bison and spinach. The bison ended up being freezer burnt to the point of being inedible. So I put some chicken tenderloins on instead. I don't know exactly what happened but I've never tasted chicken so freaking horrible in my life. It was like chewing on a tire! It was fresh and I knew for a fact I hadn't overcooked it.

By this point I was hungry and frustrated so I popped a frozen meal in the microwave. And then I went to the store and bought 65 dollars worth of TV dinners. My plan to cook more at home failed but at least the frozen meals I bought had decent protein and vegetable profiles.","I messed up a bunch of food trying to cook at home more and bought a ton of frozen meals out of frustration, defeating the purpose of ""cooking at home.""","Tried to cook at home, burnt chicken tenderloins, bought 65 dollars worth of TV dinners."
"TIFU and swore at a mormon elementary school
For context I work in sales, B2B, which in our case includes education. I haven't been in the business for long, (and I'm hoping this fuck up hasn't cut my time short). The main part of my job is calling to book meetings so that we can sell our product, under the watchful eye of my manager.

So I booked an appointment with this little school. It didn't really process for me that they were Mormon, and it was honestly the sort of deal we never should've wasted our time on in the first place. To make it worse I'm pretty openly gay, so I was already coming into things at a disadvantage.

When my manager found out the details he was, reasonably, pissed, especially considering this school was about an hour's drive from the office. To try and placate him, I offered to take the lead in this meeting (something I had never done) and he let me.

I came into that meeting and what little preparation I'd done fled my mind. I was so painfully awkward that my manager ended up having to step in and save me anyway, and I didn't even realize in my panic that I'd let an ""Oh shit"" slip in my verbal diarrhea. Apparently the teacher we were meeting with looked at me like I'd actually shit my pants in front of her, I was too panicked to notice.","I met at a teacher at a Mormon school for my first b2b sales meeting, cursed in front of the teacher, and was so panicked I didn't even notice.",I swore at a Mormon elementary school.
"TIFU by putting the wrong number on a flyer
We (me and my brother) picked up a female stray cat some months ago and she happened to be pregnant. She had 5 kittens, we decided to keep 2 and find the other 3 a new owner.

We first looked for closer acquaintances who wanted kittens, but we actually aren’t that social to know enough people and we barely use social media. Luckily my brother had a coworker who adopted one of them, and he occasionally sends us updates.

Recently I went back to college so I decided to make flyers with pictures of the remaining 2 kittens and our phone numbers. I designed the whole thing on the morning and then I went directly to class. Later I put them on different faculties to get a wider reach, and when I came home a girl contacted me through Whatsapp to get info on the kitten.

I was very excited, but she told me the other number appeared to be “wrong” which confused me. I sent her my brother’s contact because he’s more attentive with the vet info, and then she told me my brother called her a f\*cking b\*tch for trying to contact him multiple times and they fought on the phone

I started to feel like I was running out of air. My brother joked a few times about replying to spam/scam calls with vulgar insults, although l always see him being gentle and polite to others and I trust him. I thought “ah, maybe he wasn’t joking and he thought the girl was a scammer?” We know people can use façades and behave differently around non-relatives so I was preparing myself to confront him about being rude to the poor girl.

Then I saw the profile picture of the contact I sent to the girl. I thought he changed it because it looked different, but when I was about to message my brother, it was the same picture as always. I told him something like “hey, there’s a girl trying to contact us about one of the kittens”, and he told me he wasn’t wasn’t receiving any calls at all. Here’s where I realized my mistake.

I had two different numbers attributed to the “brother” contact: his current one and his old one. I put his old number in the flyers without knowing it and its current owner was being called mistakenly. If only I had deleted the old number, it wouldn’t have showed up when sharing it.

I sent the girl his current number, I explained her my mistake and apologized for what she went through because she seemed to be very affected. I also messaged the wrong number to also apologize (he had no business in being such a jerk tho). At least she understood and we’re now in process to give her the kitten.

I cried for about a hour because I felt like garbage. If only I had shown my brother the flyer before printing it, he could have noticed his number was wrong and nothing of this could have happened. Maybe other potential owners were also insulted horribly after calling the wrong number and they didn’t dare to call mine.","I put my brother’s old number in a flyer I made to get our kittens adopted, so the wrong guy got mistakenly called and he was an \*sshole to a potential owner, which could have happened to more people who just wanted a kitten.",I accidentally put the wrong number on a flyer and now my brother thinks the girl is a scammer.
"TIFU ran into a coworker at a seedy establishment
So, today I decided I would go by a local adult theater I’d heard about on my way home from work.  Went in, checked things out for a few minutes and decided to head home.  On the way out (but still in the theater), I ran into a coworker just coming in.  Someone who is a superior but not my direct superior.  I am confident that he realized who I was, we said nothing but made eye contact.  I was MORTIFIED and, of course, immediate thoughts of losing my family, my job, or at the very least, being the talk of the office started running through my head.  I love my job and am so afraid I’ve completely jeopardized it over a stupid lapse in judgment.  Pretty sure I won’t sleep until I know this is behind me . . .

"TIFU by being too loud and not checking if anyone was home
Me (18 F) and my boyfriend (18 M) are just at the end of highschool / going into college and Uni so we still live at out parents house. I have a big family of 6 ppl and my bf has 4 ppl including himself. We r young adults in a relationship so obviously we are going to be intimate with eachother but the issue is that I have trouble being quiet sometimes so we normally engage when no one is home at either house (most of the time his because there are less people to worry about) So I was over at his place and the rest of his family went out to party or go shopping since it was the weekend, we had thought everyone had left so we started getting into it and didn't worry about how loud eachother was being because no one was supposed to be home. we had been cuddling after when we heard creaking and it scared tf outta us so my bf had gone to check what it was and it was his little brother walking around who was not supposed to be there.

"TIFU I crossed a big boundary at work and almost got fired today
Today I fucked up at work. 

I am somewhat involved in HR so I know what people make. My husband works within the same company and I pushed him to be assertive for more pay at his review knowing what new hires are making to secretly find fairness. He has 2 years of experience vs people with 10+ and in a dispute with a new hire he leveraged that information causing a good candidate to quit. We both almost lost our jobs today and I’m shameful of my actions. 

I didn’t mean to make the owners feel like I was going around the company and I did not keep the confidence of my position apart from my spouse, my feelings were to help motivate and push my passive husband to assert himself with what he should be paid.

"TIFU by bottoming
So, I was feeling abit hot under the collar and recently purchased a new butt plug a little larger than I was used to. all was going well and I was enjoying myself, the full feeling made me want more and so I hopped on Grindr, and found a cute guy to come over to let’s just say ‘test the plumbing’. I answered the door, plug in situ and we started getting to it, the lights went off and he removed my new purchase from inside of me and placed it tentatively on the side. After taking me to pound town for all of 2 minutes he finished, and then after catching our breath he jumped up to get a towel and clean up. After he turned the light on there was a short pause followed by a ‘oh shit’ from him. I looked up at him to see his cock covered in blood, to then look at the butt plug laying on the side also covered in blood. What followed was a 111 call, a trip to A & E, 5 blood tests, and a CT scan.

"TIFU by eating popcorn
I recently got braces in my lower teeth and decided that eating a bowl of popcorn wouln't be that bad since I have had them for a few days now. Guess what? I was wrong. After few popcorn's I felt the archwire a bit out of place at a part where is a spring too and I ignored it because I wanted to finish my popcorn first. Really bad idea. After I finished I rushed to a mirror to see how bad it was. And it was really bad. I couldn't find the spring and the archwire wasn't connected to that part of bracked anymore. I told my father and he wasn't mad,but dentist's aren't cheap and  I still don't know if the spring is going to come out inside me any time soon.

"TIFU by falling asleep on my best friend.
Obligatory this was last week. My (25m) best friend (27m) who I’ll name John have been best friends since teenagers. We met over Xbox live and became close friends after realising that we only lived around an hour away from each other and would hang out in person often. 

When I turned 23 I started renting an apartment close to my work and John moved in to help cover rent. That’s been the situation since and it was great. I can confidently say he’s my best friend, in our time living together we’ve never had any of the typical “room mate issues” I see people complain about. 

But then last week we were watching a movie and both pretty exhausted because of work. Half way through the movie I fell asleep and woke up holding onto him. Head on his chest, arm around his mid section. He didn’t move me because I “looked too comfortable.” And honestly I was. So comfortable in fact that I didn’t really get off him. I moved my arm but kept my head on his chest. I should have just sat up and I don’t know why I didn’t, but he didn’t seem to mind and ended up putting his arm around me. 
After the movie I went to bed and couldn’t get to sleep. All I could think of his how good it felt to be that close to him. 

So that’s my life now I think? It’s been a week and he hasn’t said anything about it but it’s literally all I can think about. I like the way he felt and he smells really good too which I guess I never noticed. Am I gay now or did I just like feeling safe? Who knows. Either way im being weird around him now. Can’t really look at him, I don’t sit next to him on the couch and if we have touched (bumping into each other or handing something to him) I feel like I go into a panic and end up finding an excuse to leave the room. 
I just wanted things to go back to normal abut now I’m convinced they never will.","cuddled my best friend one single time and now I can’t be normal around him. 


Update: a few people asked so here we go. (Apologies for how long it is)

Firstly thank you for all the comments, they were all either helpful or made me laugh, so thanks. 

So I didn’t super know what to say to him when he got home and ended up apologising for being weird the last week. I basically told him that I knew I was acting off and didn’t want him to think anything was wrong or weird between us; but the cuddling that happened was new and gave me mixed feelings. None of them bad, it was just confusing. He let me get it all out, and at one point I mentioned “everyone was saying how normal platonic cuddling is and I agree” and he asked who I meant by “everyone.” 

So then I told him I made a Reddit post about it and he asked if he could read it to better understand how I’ve been feeling. Once he read the post I asked him how he felt about everything and he said that he had been worried he’d done something wrong when I was acting distant around him, but he personally didn’t feel weird about holding me. It wasn’t a big deal to him to cuddle up with friends but he knows I’m pretty awkward and a little neurotic so he didn’t want to bring it up and make me feel worse. 

We talked so much I actually don’t remember a lot of it but some ways into the conversation he asked about the “am I gay” comment (which I admit was badly worded). John is pansexual, he has been since I met him so he’s pretty open about it, it’s never really been something I even considered until a week ago but oh boy have I done some considering in the last week.  I said it felt a little like a crush, but I wasn’t sure if 1) I was just needing affection or 2) this was just a fleeting thing. He said that was fine, and nothing had to change if I didn’t want it to which was ultimately a huge relief. He also said if I still feel like I have a crush later we can “take things one step at a time.” but he’d be open to “exploring that further” if I was

(i feel like the way I felt after he said that sort of gave me my answer to if it’s crush or not; but I agree with him that we shouldn’t jump to conclusions and take it slow.)

After the big long talk we watched tv (yes. Cuddling) and i feel a lot less confused about it this time. I don’t think they’ll be a need for another update, but thanks again so much for all the comments and really helpful advice. You all gave me the confidence to talk to him about this and it ended up going way better than expected.

TL;DR 2: everyone who said I might be a little gay wasn’t entirely wrong.",fell asleep on my best friend last week and it’s been a week and he hasn’t said anything about it.
"TIFU trusting my ex-dealer's measurements
There's a saying in data science: garbage in garbage out. It doesn't matter how elegantly you process information if that information was shit to begin with. And that is exactly what I did the other night doing some weed math.

I've only be using weed for about a year and a half. Started at the recommended amount and slowly worked up my dosage. But about a year ago I got a new dealer who sold me some edibles he claimed were 150 mg each. So, I tried 1/6th of it. And felt almost nothing. So every week at the start of the weekend I would do a little more until I found the right amount for me: 3/4ths of the edible. Now, I thought it was crazy that I needed 112.5 mg for a good high (For context, I now know that 40 mg is viewed by some as a Hero's dose), but that's what my math said and the edibles were cheap so I just went with it.

Then a couple months back my dealer dropped off and I was on the search for new edibles. Found a new shop who sold edibles for double the price and only 60 mg, but you take what you can get.

I knew it was the wisest to start slow. Deep down I knew that if I was going with online recommendations that I should only be doing something like 10-25 mg. But that would be NOTHING to me. I could handle this. So, figured that the 60 mg - nearly 1/2 of what I should be used to - was a great starting point.

An hour later, I was naked sitting in my shower breathing my way through a panic attack. It felt like all the times you mess up as a kid and don't know what the consequences are going to be when you get caught. You just know it's going to be bad. Wave after wave of terror rolled over my body.

After throwing up, I was able to clean up and lie in bed. I felt the forces of gravity and waves of light pulling and twisting my body. If I tried to turn to be on my side pain washed over me. The only thing I could do was lay on my back with my arm blocking all light from hitting my eyes.

Eventually I fell asleep and woke up towards the end of the trip. I noticed the snacks I had prepared for what I thought was going to be a great night. I gingerly fed myself back to full strength and have recommitted to following the wise recommendations of the internet.","Old dealer was selling me edibles that were way less powerful than he claimed, but I only figured that out by taking WAY too much of an edible from a new dealer.","Took 60 mg of edibles, had a panic attack, woke up naked in the shower breathing my way through it."
"TIFU by trying to make a video game of our house
This happened a few years ago, i'm a person who driven a lot by conservation and archival work, and probably nostalgia in general, one day i was thinking about an old computer game called myst, it was made in the 1990s and it looked amazing for the time because it was lots of pictures with areas you click on to interact, and then i came up with a great idea.

  
I wanted to document how i lived in this point of time by making a video game like myst, all i had to do was take lots of photos and then link them together using something.

  
It technically would have been a virtual tour, not a game, but i didn't really care, ever since i was a kid i wanted to create something like a game but never had the skill, i even rushed out to download unreal engine when i found out they made it free, could never make anything good, but photos and hyperlinks? yea i can do that.

  
I did some research and found the old games like myst were made in something called hypercard, but it was for old macs, i don't have a mac let alone an old one, but more research and i found that powerpoint is pretty similar and can do those things, but i didn't have powerpoint on my computer back then either, so i decided to use the next best thing, google slides.

  
So i chose a small room at the back of the house and took some photos, uploaded them to my google and then on my computer started trying to make something that worked.

  
It was very hard, you have to make sure your clickspots link to the right places, or you'll teleport, for navigation i made an interface consisting of some arrows you could click to move around, left/right to rotate and forward/back to go forward and back, click a door then hit forward to move to that room.

  
So i was working on this and my nosy brother walks into the room, he asked what i was working on, i just said nothing special, a personal project.

  
He walked closer to the screen and said 'no, what is that?' 'your trying to make our whole house viewable online?' because google slides runs in a browser, he thought it was on the greater internet, and apparently one picture of a door was our whole house.

  
He tells my parents, who give me an earful about what i'm doing, my parents aren't clueless boomers, but i didn't bother trying to explain, just that i wasn't doing what they thought i was.

  
Pretty sure i deleted the assets afterward and didn't go back to the idea, that is, until i got an iPhone with the 3D scanner and discovered powerpoint could work with 3D models and even move around them doing some macro wizardry.","My brother saw navigation arrows and a picture of a room in our house in an open browser tab on my computer, goes and tells my parents that i'm trying to publish our entire house for the world to see, chaos ensues, project is cancelled.","I made a video game of my house using google slides, my brother thought it was on the greater internet."
"TIFU : Dozed at an inopportune time
I had an okay day today, relatively productive. Helped my father cut back some trees, hauled off some scrap metal, etc. I had a little bit to drink in the evening and dozed off. I had been on here for a few hours earlier in the day off and on, and I often comment on posts where people seem to need a kind ear, as I have most certainly been there before and wish I had had someone extend that same offer to me. 

It would seem one of the posts I commented on decided to take me up on this offer while I was dozing. As I was asleep, I was clearly unable to reply immediately. I received a second message an hour later (based on timestamp) implying I had only extended the offer to make myself look good. This was absolutely not the case, I just dozed off and missed it.

Now when I look at their profile it shows nothing. No posts, no comments, nothing. It worries me because they were in a vulnerable state and I might have inadvertently made it worse because I missed the message during a nap. I'm scared for them.

"TIFU by fumbling a beautiful girl who became ridiculously famous
This is a long read my friends, strap in. So this all started two years ago when I was 18 and got a job at an amusement park. For context, my city is notoriously boring. But every July, for ten days, this park opens, and every, I mean EVERY teenager in a city of one million people flood the gates, desperate for some kind of social interaction.

One night, after finishing my shift at a Philly cheesesteak food truck, I met up with some friends to walk around and mingle. As we strolled through the crowded park, something or rather, someone caught my eye. And when I say ""caught my eye,"" I mean I was blinded by an ethereal human being in my peripheral vision. We'll call her Sonia.

I won’t describe her in detail (for obvious reasons), but just know that she was absolutely stunning. Like, the kind of stunning that makes everyone stop and stare. My friends saw her too and, realizing I was the only single guy in the group, immediately started egging me on. They dared me to go talk to her.

Now, here’s the thing, women don’t usually make me nervous. I’ve had my fair share of experiences and am kind of used to girls coming up to me instead. But this girl? This girl was different. With every step I took toward her, my knees got weaker, and a lump in my throat formed. Luckily, I noticed she was standing with a girl I had mutual friends with. I pulled that friend aside and told her to relay a note to Sonia. She took my message to her and came back to inform me that she wanted to talk to me.

I walked up, extended my hand, and she shook it. I tried to play it cool as we made small talk. That’s when I found out we’d both be attending the same university in the fall. We exchanged contacts, and I walked away feeling like I had just won the lottery.

When I got home, I told my brother about what happened, and he lost his mind when I said her name. Turns out, Sonia was a TikToker with 300,000 followers and, apparently, one of his biggest crushes.

Now, my for you page was mostly gym content and funny videos, so I wasn’t really on that side of TikTok. But honestly? I wasn’t surprised when he told me that.

Coincidentally, I used to post thirst traps on TikTok too, and they went semi-viral, which gave me and Sonia something to talk about. We started messaging back and forth, and when fall came, we began hanging out at the university library. Now here's where things started to derail. Sonia was probably the most extroverted person I had ever met. Almost too extroverted. She had this insane ability to strike up a conversation with literally fucking anyone.

And honestly? That wasn’t my style. I preferred women who were a bit more reserved, quiet, mysterious, the kind of girls you had to really get to know. I just didn’t have the energy to constantly jump into conversations with strangers to feel included. Eventually, I started distancing myself from Sonia. Our hangouts became less frequent, our messages slowed down, and before long, we stopped talking altogether.

About three months later, Sonia posted her first YouTube video. It instantly went viral. She kept posting, and within over a month, hit one million subscribers and was everywhere on TikTok.

At first, I thought it was just a lucky break that their fame would plateau after a while.

Fuck, was I wrong.

I witnessed Sonia’s TikTok account skyrocket from 300K to over 10 million followers in a year. She was everywhere.

That summer, I visited some relatives in another city, and when my little cousin found out Sonia followed me on TikTok, she freaked out. She begged me to call her, but for some reason, I just… couldn’t.

I felt like if I reached out after she became famous, I’d look like some clout chaser trying to creep back into her life. So I didn’t. Also, we clearly weren’t compatible so I knew it would be a mistake to reach out.

That summer, she dropped out of university to pursue social media full-time.

I still can’t believe this actually happened. And I can’t help but wonder, if things went further, how different my life could have been?","I never could’ve predicted that someone from my city where nothing exciting ever happens would blow up like this. And now, every time I open TikTok, my fyp is flooded with content of her. Clips from her YouTube videos. Seeing her hang out with celebrities in LA.

"TIFU by asking my gf to be more vocal in bed
So this is a pretty simple tifu that happened years ago, but it still lives in my head rent free.

I was in college, and dating this girl who was a little more on the introverted/shy side. We had good sexual chemistry, but she tended to be very quiet during sex. I, like most people, like it when my partner lets me know they’re feeling good, so I started to ask her to be more vocal during sex. At one point this conversation took place:

Me: “I would really like it if you let me know when I’m making you cum” 

Her: “What am I supposed to say?”

Me: “I don’t know, whatever comes to mind. I’ll just enjoy you letting me know when it’s happening”

Fast forward to the next time we’re doing the deed. She’s being very quiet, but I can tell she’s getting close. I can see her getting wound tighter but getting ready to say something. I’m very much appreciating that she’s about to do what asked… and then she says it…

“Bombs away!” 

All heat of the moment was entirely lost on me as the intense romantic immersion was shattered. 

Afterwards when I asked her to please never say it that way again she obviously replied “well you said I could say anything.” 

We eventually broke up for, believe it or not, overall communication issues in the relationship. 

TL/DR: I asked my gf at the time to let me know when I got her to completion and the phrase she chose was “bomb’s away!”",,"Asked my gf to be more vocal during sex, she said “bomb’s away!”"
"TIFU by not adding a second _ to my username when signing up
For context, I [16M] love gaming. Like, a lot. It gives me an escape from my shit life. Speaking of my shit life, in the past year I’ve lost around $550 to shipping issues and other bullshit in my eBay selling hustle.

My bank account got hacked and I was threatened by people who knew where I lived, saying they were gonna throw a brick through my front window. I was almost arrested for ‘fraud’.

I’m alone. My brother’s out all day, and my sisters have moved out. My mom’s always on the phone and I have a language barrier with my dad, who’s working half the time. When I come back from school at 5:30 I just sit in my room and watch TikToks all day. It’s depressing. I’m depressed.

So when I heard of the new skate. playtesting release, I was so happy; Skate 3 was one of my favourite games, and I had to play the new one. 

In eagerness, I completed the survey. As I play on PS4, EA needed my PSN username, so I entered it. And added one underscore instead of 2. I didn’t notice the mistake until today. At the first day of playtesting where the sign up window expired. 

My eagerness faded instantly. I don’t even know why, but I broke down crying. I’m crying as I write this. I probably sound like a spoiled brat, but I am grateful for everything that I have. Some people don’t even own PS4s. It’s kinda like the ‘straw that broke the camels back’ analogy. 

I hope this doesn’t come across as stupid or spoilt or anything, just wanted to share my fuckup.","Didn’t realise I didn’t add a second underscore for my PSN username for the new Skate. playtest, can’t play it now. FML",I didn’t add a second underscore to my PSN username when signing up for skate.
"TIFU: Leaving a pile of clutter on my workbench.
Today i was going to do an oil change on my daily car.
I notice my handy worklight battery is empty so i change that out and go hunting for the charger.

My workbench is a mess from all kinds of diy adventures over the winter and afterwards being too tired to clean it up.

There is a 750ml can of high expansion PU construction foam on the workbench that only had like 2 good puff's out of it, so nearly full.

Attempting to drag the cable of the charger from under the clutter ofc the can of PU foam drops and it hits a flat head long screwdriver thats poking out of a box of old junk.

It instantly punctures and starts spraying all over the place, narrowly missing my face in the progress.

Being in my garage i has just turned on some tunes to start working.

The song could not be more fitting, about 30 seconds into this song the accident happend:

Juno reactor- Navras

Franticly grabbing the can and wrapping it in whatever i could find wich turned out to be a baby blanket from when my wife last gave birth a few years ago that was on top of a storage box. Wife wasn't happy about that.

With the can still spraying inside the blanket and the super sticky foam expanding on all sides i yell to my wife to grab some trash bags.

We quickly triple wrap it and trow it in a bin.
Now i have a foam cleanup and a car maintenance to do while my garage and the walkway to the bin is full of sticky expanding PU foam... great sunday evening that was.

"TIFU by being too good at my job?
Ok so this actually happened a year ago but this story comes to the front of my mind every so often so I thought I’d share. You guys are in for a fucking ride. 

I started working for a bar in early 2023. At the time I was a full time student in college and had another full time job on top of that. I only worked as a bartender 1-2 times a week to get some extra income. 

So cut forward to the end of 2023 and my manager- let’s call him Luke- gets demoted (for reasons I’m not too sure of) and so we get a new manager- let’s call him Chad. Things start off good and I actually start to like him more than my old manager. But then at the beginning of 2024 it was like a flip switched and suddenly he was pretty temperamental anytime I saw him. 
Oh and he changed the entire cocktail menu without telling me and I had to work on the fly my first day with them. Around Feb/March he asks if there’s any other days I could work since he’s hiring a bunch of new people (we were very understaffed at this time so that was nice to hear) and my availability didn’t work well with those he hired. I tell him no because I have another job. But I tell him that if he lets me know what days he wants me to work then I can move my availability around at my other job. 

A little later I check my schedule and I’m not scheduled at all for the last 2 weeks of March. I ask Chad why that is and he responds that there were no available shifts since he’s training all the new hires. I try not to think much of it and accept that answer. 
Then the beginning of April comes by and I text Chad asking when I’ll be able to work again and he doesn’t respond. 

The next day I get an email from Chad notifying me of my termination of employment. The reason was availability and recent performance. Availability I kind of understood but I had already told him if he let me know ahead of time I could open up my availability. But performance? I didn’t understand at all. I’d had multiple customers come up to me and tell me how much they liked me. Luke had even told me I was one of his best employees. 

I was angry. And I told literally everyone about it. My dad eventually convinced me to respond to Chad and tell him that what he did was not ok. So I told him that everything he did was unprofessional and I would like to know what complaints I’ve gotten on my performance. He responds the next day saying that “simply put your performance wasn’t up to standard” and that the position had been filled so it was the end of the matter. I was beyond perplexed and the hate I felt for this man was growing by the second. 

So skip forward a couple months, I go out to a bar with my friend (who I used to work with at the forsaken bar) and coincidentally Luke and all the current employees of the forsaken bar were there hanging out. So Luke approaches us and we start talking. He tells me that it was wrong for me to be fired and hopes I don’t hold anything against him. Eventually he gets to why I was fired. He said Chad was getting a lot of pressure from management because I was making the company more money than him. He said that Chad made up complaints about me so that I would look bad. Eventually Chad decided to fully get rid of me. 

I know I probably have some grounds to sue or something but I really know nothing about the law plus that shit is probably expensive. There’s no satisfying resolution, sadly. Hope you enjoyed.",I was making the bar I worked for more money than my manager so he made up lies to get me fired.,I was fired for being too good at my job.
"TIFU by scrolling through tumblr at work.

Let me set the stage for you all.

It’s 4:50. 10 minutes to closing. No customers are coming in, I’m bored. I decided to mindlessly scroll through my tumblr. The only tags I follow are video game related with an occasional piece of artwork or a text meme. Harmless, right? Well, as I scroll the handset next to me rings. While continuing to scroll, I talk on the handset with a customer. Then I look down.

A fucking gif of a woman flashing her bare chest is on my screen. At work. When I’m surrounded by my coworkers.

I immediately yelled out, and closed my phone, person still on the handset. He sounded confused, and asked if everything is alright.

How that got on my fyp? I have no idea. Looks like it was a bot that spammed tags. 


Anyways, Im PRAYING none of my coworkers saw. I know the cctv didnt see it. But if they did, I’m absolutely cooked. HR isnt happy with me for my excessive absences and tardiness (depression has been bad).

Nobody saw, I don’t think. But I’m not 100% sure. I do know I’m severely anxious, though.

"TIFU by locking a customer in the store however they found it hilarious
Hello all,

As the title states, I fucked up today by locking a customer in the store I work at. 
I work at a small business baby store, now, I check every time before I go on lunch to see if someone was in the store, I did just that, I checked the store. After I turn around and do the 'we'll be back soon', sign. 
Anyway, about 10 minutes into my lunch, my boss calls. She is pissed. She tells me I locked someone in the store. I run to the shop and here is the security guard, the lady's friend and the lady stuck in the store absolutely pissing themselves in laughter. 
I spend about 5 minutes apologising and offering for them to shop in the store while the door is closed, they declined and told me to enjoy my lunch. 
I was and am mortified. Like how are you finding this funny? How is this the highlight of your day? How did I make you day?

"TIFU: DROPPED WEIGHTS ON FLOOR NOT IN MY HOUSE....
TIFU by thinking i could work out. I'm currently house sitting for a family friend and i fucked up by going to take weights off a bar and forgetting heavy thing goes down and only removed one side first. (stupid i know, not the point) it dropped and when it hit the floor i guess it fucked up the floorboards under the carpet. there's a huge dent and its pretty obviously damaged and not safe to step on. its on the second floor, how much would it cost to fix and how difficult would it be to repair?

 i would rather fix it on my own without anyone having to know but im aware this is probably not going to happen. I hate confrontation and i really don't want to upset this family.  I feel horrible. I know they would probably be a little annoyed and possibly laugh but im mortified and wishing i could do anything to change what just happened.","dropped heavy thing on carpeted floor on the second story. difficulty and repair cost? panicking. please help. scared of disappointment and people being mad at me....



UPDATE: texted the owners shoutout to two of you who soothed my fears. My dad is a contractor and has been working in construction for longer then I've been Alive so he swung by and confirmed what reddit has told me [the subfloor broke] and that he could fix it no worries. The owners assured me it was OK, and accidents happen. Thanked me for telling them and then asked for more pictures of their pets.  Thank you everyone for advice!

"TIFU by digging too deep into a true crime case and stumbling across the picture of the victim
Yeah, the title pretty much says it all. More of a rant though.

I watched a true crime episode and got invested, looked for the instagram account of the victim etc, because I wanted to see what comments were being left behind. I‘ll admit I was very aware that it was very clear that the picture of the victim after the murder had been circulating online, but for some reason, I didn’t expect to stumble across it.

I read the comments and was utterly shocked and disgusted with humanity, because there were just too many horrible comments, and that’s when I checked out one of the profiles leaving such horrible comments, and clicked on his highlights and looked at the stuff he was posting. It had a pretty dark theme and I was like „alright, I see, fucked up guy.“ and only then realized, that the next picture was not some sick artwork, but just a collage of the dead girl with her slashed throat.

And honestly, that did something to me. I know, FAFO, but damn. And much more important, how in the hell is it possible, that such accounts exist and have a few thousand followers?","I watched a true crime show, researched the victim and its social media presence and stumbled across the pictures the murderer took and uploaded.",I stumbled across the picture of the victim in a true crime episode and was disgusted.
"TIFU by dropping my phone into the toilet
By managing to accomplish the I-Dropped-My-Phone-in-The-Toilet achievement. This is a real low point. This hurts. 

I love pajama shorts but they don't always have the deepest or the most practical pockets. And phones don't fit well vertically or horizontally and even diagonally. 

They end up being top heavy and my phone decided to fling itself out and into the toilet. 

I didn't even know what fell and I figured I'd pick it up later/after. But thank god I bothered to look. 

And now I sit here and I find myself wondering, why couldn't I be basic AF and accidentally drop it into a pool or a lake.

"TIFU by biting off more of my nail than i usually do when i do so
Today, i decided to bite the tip of my nail off, as it was slightly grown out. This isn't too unusual for me to do. But today, i ripped off a lot more nail than i initially realized.

I was biting off my nail like (what i thought was) usual, but this time I bit off almost half off the whole nail. It's still attached somehow so i now just have to hope it's not gonna be painful by the time it does end up coming off. I don't know if there's anything I can do to make it less painful than just letting it fall off naturally if that even ends up happening. If anyone has experience with this or suggestions on what I might be able to do about it, anything is welcome (assuming it's sound-semisound advice obviously).

Also, no, i don't have any anxiety disorder or anything that i know of, i just nail-bite out of boredom.","Bit off half of my fingernail, don't know what to do about it","TIFU by biting off more than i usually do when i do so, don't know what to do to make it less painful."
"TIFU by eating three whole yellow dragon fruits
So, I decided to prep all my fruit from the grocery trip in advance. Sounds like a great idea, right? Wrong! My first mistake was not pre-measuring it. My second (and biggest) mistake was taking the whole bowl to work and devouring it without a second thought.

If you're familiar with yellow dragon fruit, you know where this is going. Let's just say it's not exactly known for its... digestive subtlety. Fast forward to me being stuck in the bathroom at work, unable to do my job because because I am here. I am already behind because we have been a man down for over a week.

"TIFU by making dead baby jokes around my pregnant cousin
Obligatory ""this wasn't today"". In fact it was over a decade ago. I was an immature tween, I obviously wouldn't do this today. The kid was fine too.

Back then, the ""dead baby"" jokes I learned from the other Boy Scouts were the funniest thing to me. They weren't even clever, just edge, like ""How do you get a dead baby out of a bowl? With chips!"" Again, edgy tween.

Anyway, since these were the Funniest Thing I Had Ever Heard^(TM), I told them to *everyone*. So at one family gathering, I tried telling them to my cousins, who were much older than me. She and her husband seemed very uncomfortable with the jokes, and I couldn't figure out why they weren't laughing.

"TIFU by saving a bone for later
So my dog is a Chihuahua, vet said she might be a Chihuahua mixed with a chiwinnie, IDRC she's my sweet shadow following me everywhere. A few weeks ago I got her a bone to chew, but I got the one that was cut in half, so you get two bones with little fleshy bits everywhere, and easy access marrow. She loves them, I usually give her an upstairs bone and downstairs bone, but as I am ever so clever, this time I opened the bone and gave her one side. The other side went into a Ziploc bag, and into the closet on the treat shelf, but towards the back, because I figured she'd chew it for a while, which she did. 

Welp, it turns out that the plastic the bones are in somehow keeps them from molding, I thought the bag looked a little white, but I figured it was just the double bagging. So no glove, I reached straight in and grabbed the wet bone and pulled it out, instead of red, it was grey and green! I yelped and dropped it, my excited pup immediately ran to grab it and I had to take it away, cuz no!!!! Anywho, she's giving me side eyes, and I'm a liar and a thief. I promised a bone, and then I took it away!!! 

I'm going to put the double bagged bone in the freezer next time.... Looks like we're going to the pet store in the morning. She loves to chew, I have never had a dog bone go bad before.

"TIFU by spilling a gallon of laundry soap on the rug
So this just happened earlier today. I put the soap on the dryer right next to the washer. No big deal. I’ve done it before. But I was tempting fate all these years. The dryer has a curved hood, and it jiggles around when it drys. So when I put my clothes in, it fell off. I didn’t realize that it has happened until I went to check in on the progress. That’s when I realized what had happened.

Between the two rugs is about an inch of empty space, where it’s concrete. The jar fell right on top of the cap and broke into several pieces, leaving the bottle to spill everywhere. I’m at a loss of what to do. It’s too engrained into the carpet at this point, it’s completely made a mess of the thing.

I am a man. Men have facial hair. I am clumsy. Clumsy people still have facial hair. This can only go well. Or so i thought. This happened an hour ago.

Every other month i shave my face with an electric clipper before i take a shower. Fair enough. Ive done it for a while i know what im doing. Some family is coming over such as mom, stepdad, cousins, all for a weekly dinner we have. And i got a little scruffy in the face.

Cut to the bathroom, im shaving in the shower (drain plugged so i can clean it easily) with a handheld shower wand as a mirror, shaving my mustache first then my beard. Then as im working on my right sideburn i accidentally knock something over and i go to catch it...

And the clipper is still running. Half my eyebrow was freaking gone. I didnt move my hand but my head went into the clipper and half my eyebrow vanished. Now you can tell how clumsy i am. So i panick and try to fix it... only to make it worse. 

Five minutes go by and i fucked up so badly my whole eyebrow was gone. The only thing i could bring myself to do was finish the job... i finish shaving my face and... the other eyebrow. In an attempt to look balanced.

I look in the mirror after drying off... im freaking dying. Keep in mind i have a mullet haircut... and my facial hair and eyebrows are gone. I look like an uglier Dana White with hair. And keep in mind this is before my family gets here. I told them what happened but they havent seen it yet.

Yesterday was not a good day for me or my family.

Well my dumbass gets to it and i’m thinking maybe I could use shortcuts. So I cut the big branches that all the little ones we’re connected to, and my stupid ass was wondering why it was so hart to push off the tree log. I finally get it all off and there’s tree branches all over the backyard, making difficult to get back inside. Also the tree looked pretty much dead, but no, I didn’t think nothing of it. I proudly go to my dad saying I cut the branches off and when he goes to check, he’s in shock. He had no idea what to say about what just happened, but he didn’t take it nearly as hard as my mom did. She was crying her eyes out and asking me questions such as “What made you think it was ok to treat the tree like that?”, “How could you not see what you were doing was horrible??”.

"TIFU by being unreasonably upset over a petty thing
I agree I've been unreasonably emotional lately. Its annoying but I'm aware of it. My husband often corrects me, advices me, asks me to be more social, more hardworking, change my style, my lifestyle and routine etc. 

I try to the best of my ability to make those changes but obviously it takes time. 

This one time when he was being reminded by his mother that he is not drinking enough water and being dehydrated, I grab on to the opportunity to playfully tease him saying, ""and he reminds me to keep hydrated"" to which he gave such a rude look and said Im not the one pregnant and nagging. 

Now it was no big deal but here comes the water works! It immediately upset me tho it was no big deal it just made me emotional for a moment, I thought just one time, I correct him on something and he cant take it sportingly. I never do! Just once and.. He was rude! (Ik! Kinda immature of me)

So I went to sleep earlier than expected. He asked if I was okay, I said yeah but just didnt feel like talking. 

I woke up feeling pretty lame, but then began the regret when I saw him go work early, without saying goodbye, when I messaged him like usual, he left it at seen. When he came back from work, he didn't bother to even look at me. And me being me, I just... Played along. Gave him space! And now its been 2 days! 

Theres no talking or initiation from either of us and to make matters worse, I had an argument with my mil (which too was unnecessary) and now both of them probably hate me.

So it's 11 PM, dark outside, and I head out to pick up some late dinner. After 15 steps out of my apartment I see a girl dressed in all black reaching into my neighbor's window with all the lights off. Additionally, I noticed they took off the window screen and had it laying on the ground. I asked them ""are you good?"", to which they only replied with a weird arm gesture without saying anything at all. Spidey senses were tingling at this point and I just kept walking to my car. Something important to mention is that in my general area, there is a good share of drug addicts and homeless people - though she definitely didn't look homeless so I assumed the former. At this point alarm sirens were going off in my head, especially since she was so close to my own apartment. I called 911 and reported a possible break-in, described the details, and went on my way to pick up dinner. 15 minutes later when I get back, 2 policemen are at the door. I ask them what happened, and one of them says, laughingly, ""she was a daughter trying to sneak out.""

"TIFU by making the worst decision of my life: shaving my ass hair
Last night, I trimmed my ass hair. Felt clean as hell. Took a quick 2-minute shower, completely unaware of what was coming, and passed out like a baby. Woke up in the morning, ran my hand over my ass, and damn, it was smooth. Felt amazing, no lie. Had breakfast, went to uni, finally got there, sat down, and tried to listen to the lecture. But since I spent a couple of hours last night dealing with my hairy situation, I didn’t get much sleep. So, I put my head down on the desk and knocked out.

Woke up like 1-2 hours later, and since I was sleeping in an ""L"" position, my stomach was all squished up. Felt a fart coming. No big deal, happens all the time. Thought I’d do a little stealth move, lift my right cheek slightly, and let it out nice and quiet. Lifted my cheek… and BOOM. Ten straight seconds of thunder. The whole damn desk was shaking.

Guys were laughing their asses off, girls were spraying perfume like I committed a war crime. I was beyond embarrassed. Grabbed my bag and coat, dipped out of there full speed. Bro, I wanted to disappear. Headed straight to the bus stop, still thinking, ""Why the hell couldn’t I fart silently?"" And then it hit me—last night. The shaving.

Had a realization right then and there—holy shit, it might actually be because I shaved my ass hair. Rushed home and immediately started cooking some beans. Needed to test this theory a few more times. If I still couldn’t do a silent one, then yeah, the ass hair was the reason.

So I got to cooking, but at the same time, I started researching ass hair mechanics. Few hours later, food was ready. Ate that shit up, smacking my lips like a man on a mission. Sat there waiting for the magic to happen. Five, ten minutes go by—nothing. Moved to my desk, figured I’d play some games while waiting.

About 10-15 minutes later, it was go-time. Closed the game, lifted the right cheek, and BAM. Another loud one. No doubt about it now—this was 100% because I shaved my ass hair.

It’s been a week since that day. Haven’t gone back to uni. Became a meme in the group chats, got turned into WhatsApp stickers. I swear, I’m not stepping foot in there until my ass hair grows back. To anyone thinking of shaving down there—DON’T. You’ll end up raw and exposed like me. Ass hair is life. Ass hair makes your farts silent.

"TIFU by wanting a candlelit bath
I had a pretty rough week so I decided to reward myself with a nice bath. I also love scented candles so I lit those up to make it even nicer.

However, I guess I was tired from not getting enough sleep the whole week and barely having dinner and whatnot, so I kinda forgot you DO NOT LEAVE THE CANDLES UNSUPERVISED. I got distracted for a second, and then I smelled burning plastic. Apparently, in a stroke of genius, I failed to see that a) my mom's pink bath sponge was lying way to close to one of the candles and b) bath sponges were in fact flammable. Now the bath sponge was fizzing and melting and turning black and the smell was awful.

"TIFU by not bringing my passport to check in at a hotel
this was not actually today but back in december. i am posting it now as a lesson to others to hopefully avoid anyone being in my situation, bc it was NOT fun. so, back in december, i was on my first solo overseas trip. i was in europe for a study abroad program as my uni has a campus in italy. on weekends, all the students would leave our study abroad accom & go off to another italian city, since we had 3 day weekends & free rein, & italy is easy to get around. a friend & i decided to go to venice.

when we met at our study abroad accom lobby before catching the train, she asked if i’d brought my passport and i said, “nah, i have a photo of it though, don’t worry - we’re only going to venice for one night so it’ll be fine, i’d rather leave it locked in our accom & avoid it getting pickpocketed!”… so i thought. i’ve used photos of my passport as ID many times when checking into hotels. i even had a live photo as proof that it wasn’t doctored.

eventually, we got to venice & were checking in, when the receptionist at our hostel said he would not be able to check us in as he needed to scan a physical passport. i had actually thought he would only check my friend’s passport, regardless of if i’d brought mine, as she’s the one who made the booking (reinforced by the fact this had been the case on the previous weekend’s trip - even though i did have my passport that time, it wasn’t even CHECKED). the receptionist said, ”don’t panic, this happens all the time. just go across the canal & get a declaration from the police that your passport is ‘lost’, and we will check you in.” i was like… ermmm okay! & so i did. felt terrible for my friend who had to wait an hour for me to return </3 but anyways, i got checked in!

i was told by venice police to make sure i went to the police station immediately the next day when i returned to my study abroad city so that i could show the physical passport and ‘unblock it’. & yes… i did that! all was well. the cops said my passport was now unblocked & gave me a letter declaring so.

everything was fine until i left the schengen zone to visit the uk for nye. at the channel crossing the border police said my passport is registered on the system as STOLEN. i was like, “wtf!!??!?! the cops said there was nothing wrong with my passport!“ the passport officer said, “well, you’re travelling with an illegal passport. you could get in trouble but i’ll let you through, just go to the aussie embassy in london immediately so they can give you an emergency passport.” of course, i did so. the officer at the embassy said, “don’t worry, on the aussie system your passport is valid… absolutely nothing wrong with it. idk why the border person said that to you.. i can’t help you, you don’t need a new passport.“ so i was relieved (especially considering aussie passports are the most expensive in the world - nearly $500 and i had JUST gotten a new 10 year one right before my trip.)

so, i thought maybe it had been a mistake at the border & everything was fine… NOPE! when i went back into schengen a week later, at the border i was once again yelled at. they said they are legally supposed to confiscate my passport as it is illegal & says it is stolen. i was like, “wtf dude i just went to the embassy & they said it has no problem.“ the police said, “we do not care, that is not what our system says. but, we will be nice & let you through just this once, but you need to go to the embassy again, otherwise, the police will take your passport away from you. seriously, they will arrest you & take your passport.“ (terrifying thing to say to a young solo traveller!)

so… i went to the embassy as soon as i got to paris! this time i had a full meeting w consulate services, who told me that it was actually illegal for the italian police to have tampered with my passport and declare it stolen or lost in the first place, especially because it was never lost at all, but just in my study abroad hotel room. the officer gave me his business card & a paper w numbers of the australian consulate so that if i was faced with harassment at the border again, i could tell the border police to call them & verify that my passport is, in fact, completely legal.

i never had to go through a schengen border for the rest of my trip (though my passport was stamped when i left the eu, no questions asked?), so i’ll never know if i would’ve been yelled at again, but the problem is, the passport is probably still flagged on whatever system those border people were using, & i might have issues next time i visit europe, & i have no idea how to fix it, as it is fine on the aussie system. all because i naively didn’t bring my passport to a one night stay in venice 🤦‍♀️ so the moral of the story is: bureaucracy sucks, & never ever go anywhere without your physical passport, no matter what. it might result in absolute hell for the rest of your holiday.","i didn’t bring my passport to a one night stay in venice and it resulted in me being harassed at the border multiple times for the rest of my trip bc the italian police ‘blocked’ my passport in order for me to be able to check into my hotel, apparently never unblocked it despite claiming to have done so, & caused my passport to be registered on the border system as stolen. 😭","didn’t bring my passport to check in at a hotel, was told by the hotel receptionist that it was ‘lost’ & was told to go across the canal to get a declaration from the police."
"TIFU by leaving my contact in for a week
Last Thursday, I (19F) was in bed and I rubbed my eyes. I didn’t think anything of it until I went to take out my contacts for the night and, lo and behold, I can’t feel anything in my left eye. I was pinching my eyeball and I only realized that there was nothing there when it hurt. I decide that I must have accidentally pushed it out when I was rubbing my eyes. Womp womp, but not a big deal because my other eye has the stronger prescription anyways. I love to complain, so I immediately complain to my roommate when I get back into my room (dorm). I’m searching my sheets but I don’t find anything, and I decide that I’m not going to find anything because it’s literally a clear contact. 

I complain to my mom and sister that I’m missing a contact, but that I can’t replace it with another from the box because I only have four weeks left of contacts (biweekly’s). It’s not that big of a problem I’ve been on spring break this week. I’ve been living my life since last Thursday with only one contact in. My left eye sometimes feels like there’s something in it, like an eyelash, but the feeling goes away when I rub my eye. Maybe it’s just allergies. I feel like my vision is getting rapidly worse every night, and that’s alarming, but I don’t say anything because I can’t get an eye appointment until April anyways (insurance). At last, this last Thursday, yesterday, comes, and I can finally change out my contacts for new ones. I put in the left one with no issue—nothing feels out of the ordinary. 

I take a shower this morning. Everything is fine—until I’m about to get out. There is for sure something in my eye and it’s not an eyelash and no matter how much I rub, it’s not fixing itself. I get out of the shower, look in the mirror, and what do I see? A CONTACT. I open my case, to be sure that I didn’t just leave it in last night, and both contacts I wore yesterday are in the case! I take it out of my eye and just stare at it in disbelief. I don’t know what pocket dimension-shadow realm I sent it to when I rubbed my eye, but it has been in there for the ENTIRE week. I have been sleeping with it in every night, I have been showering with it every day—I genuinely do not know how it hasn’t gotten infected. I’ve accidentally napped in my contacts before and woke up feeling like my eyelids were glued shut. I don’t even know how it’s possible that I didn’t notice it for a WEEK.","I thought I accidentally took out my contact, but it’s been living in my eyeball (rent-free) for the last week.","Left eye feels like there’s something in it when I rub my eyes, but I don’t know what it is."

"TIFU sending 32 emails to a professor in one hour
Yep. Saturday evening, suddenly it turns out I have 36h to submit a scientific paper which involves prof. B. 
I’ve met him only once —online—, when I was introduced to the group. All very formal. 

I spent the whole day working on the thing, and around midnight I start writing an e-mail to him. I want to say that by that time I was EXHAUSTED; I thought it might be a good idea to just send it in the morning, but I just wanted to sleep without nothing in mind. 
If midnight sounds a weird time to receive/send an e-mail you are right. It is. I’ve nothing to add.

I am a compulsive draft saver. I lost a couple of manuscripts in the past, so since then I literally ctrl-s any change I make. When I was done, I sent it. 

The day after, late afternoon, still nothing to be heard from him. So, I make a check in the “sent” folder, just to be sure I actually did send it. 

Turns out ctrl-s stands for SEND with the brand new email application I just downloaded. 

So, Prof. B received the beauty of 32 emails between midnight and 1am, showing the ENTIRE",,version of the whole thing is that I ctrl-s any change I make to my e-mail to a prof. B.

"TIFU by giving my kid Starbucks lemonade
I was in Target with my 4-year-old daughter. I swung by the Starbucks for coffee. She asked for a lemonade and a snack. I saw they had lemonade refreshers- some with strawberries and some with acai. She got super excited, so I thought I’d get her a large strawberry lemonade refresher. She loved it and chugged the whole thing before I finished my coffee.

 Well about 20-30 minutes later she is sprinting up and down the aisles, not listening to me and being generally difficult. She is a strong-willed child and what 4-year-old doesn’t have tons of energy… so I didn’t think much beyond it. I was getting frustrated though.

 My wife showed up a few minutes later and immediately noticed the wild child squeezing every stuffie she could fit into her tiny arms. She also noticed immediately the 2 drinks in the cart. She quizzed me on what I got her. Her face pretty much summed it up. She knew right away that we had a child hopped up on caffeine.

"TIFU by ranting about my son's childcare
My son's nursery have been a nightmare for a while, I'm in the UK and in September free government funding came in for children of a certain age. Unfortunately my son's nursery wasn't the best with this new funding and started acting suspiciously around bills, invoices and payments. Myself and a social worker involved with me got suspicious and realised the nursery were overcharging me and refusing to admit it. That's where the problems started.

Over the course of September-february the nursery routinely Overcharged me, leaving me struggling to afford my other bills. I got emergency low income funding which surprise surprise, the nursery messed up on and left me still paying almost more than what I earned, didn't get any of the money back and the nursery refused to talk to me or any other people overcharged in person, causing several people to quit. I stayed as my son's development was behind and his nursery were actually doing a good job at helping him get upto his milestones and he enjoyed it.

In march they brought in a compulsory payment of £5 per session and upped regular fees. Meaning id be £100 a month worse off and they gave little to no warning of this change so I put up a post asking for recommendations for a different nursery. didn't include anything about the old nursery but they saw my post and asked for me to come in for a meeting but messaged me in a very rude tone.

I'm an asisstant teacher for a 1st-3rd grade class. This one 3rd grader in particular does not like listening to me.

"TIFU by letting my roommate moon my family on facetime
Just got off a facetime with my mom and my grandmother. Just catching up while I did some chores in my shared apartment. I was cleaning the bathroom while on video and had put my phone on a shelf overlooking the whole bathroom. We were chatting while I was diligently scrubbing all the nooks and crannies, when I had the brilliant idea to quickly clean the mirror in my room too, leaving facetime running in the bathroom.

"TIFU by sending what seemed to be a booty call to a guy that asked me on a date , whom I turned down, years ago
Years ago, I was hanging out with a group of friends and friends of friends. This particular kid was a couple years younger than me in years but even more in mental age. I only knew him in the context that he was my friends friends brother. 

Anyway, he’s trying his best to be a little flirty and we must have exchanged numbers (I was not interested but was being nice). He’d text me here and there, asked me out, I declined. I felt zero attraction for him. Eventually the conversations began to become less and less frequent and just stopped all together , thankfully, and while I still have his contact saved, I deleted any messages between us (I like to keep things organized and these texts held no meaningful or relevant info)..

To this day I wouldn’t even remember this kids  name if it wasn’t for this story. 

Sometime after that, I started dating my now husband. At this point we had been together for a decent chunk of time (maybe a year?) and I had texted him with Siri countless times and it only ever went to him. 

This particular time, I told Siri to text Chris: “are you up?” At 11PM. This was not a booty call, I wanted to call him to ask something but texted first to make sure that I wouldn’t wake him.  I, again will say, I have texted my husband countless times with Siri , and it only ever texted Christopher, my husband. So when Siri sent the message “are you up?” To Kristopher, the guy that asked me out the year prior, I did not notice until he replied.

"TIFU by re-seasoning my cast iron skillets
Most nights I struggle to fall asleep due to insomnia. Sometimes it’s a couple hour fight to fall asleep, but occasionally I will just be “up” no matter what interventions. Those nights I just usually give in and decide to do quiet productive things like laundry, dishes etc… Well  earlier today my fiancé (we’ll see if the weddings still on lol) had made us dinner using one of our cast iron skillets. We have a deal that if one cooks the other cleans, and I had yet to do the dishes. 
On this particular night it was 3am when I had finally accepted that I was not going to sleep anytime soon so I went downstairs and started cleaning. I noticed our cast iron skillet looked a little discolored and after googling learned it was due to a compromised seasoning or rust. 
 I followed instructions to rub it down with some coarse salt (I don’t have chainmail) and then put a bit of the oil it came with on it with a paper towel and bake at 400°. I knew it had been a while since our other cast iron had gotten a proper seasoning so I decided to do both. I didn’t set a timer, but knew they’d be done when they started smoking and I was periodically checking on them while doing other dishes and other cleaning. 
I opened the oven, saw both of them smoking a bit and took them out. All is well. All is peaceful in the quiet of 3am. Then a minute later both fire alarms in my house start blaring the loudest shriek I’ve ever heard in my life. I run upstairs to open windows and hear my fiancé calling for me in a panic like he thought he woke up into a nightmare. I try my  best to explain while scrambling on a stool to remove the batteries from the alarm. I succeed, both alarms go quiet. 
I put my fiancé back to bed and apologize profusely. As I go to leave I hear a little chirp and realize I haven’t put the batteries in. It’s been a minute and I’ve been running the fans and opened the windows so surely it’s safe to put them back in. I worried that my  fiancé wouldn’t be able to fall back asleep with it going off every single minute. So I put the batteries back in and both alarms sprang back to life in full screeching force. 
My fiancé gets back up and quickly comes over to help me remove them again and then says we’ll live with the chirp until the morning and goes back to sleep. We’ve burned so many things way worse in our oven before and not once has the fire alarm gone off. I can’t tell who’ll hate me more in the morning, my neighbors in my complex who live in attached units to me or my fiancé when he’s exhausted at work at 8 am.","I decided to clean and re-season cast irons at 3 am while my fiancé and neighbors are sleeping, and caused fire alarms to go off multiple times throughout the night.",I re-seasoned my cast iron skillets and now they’re smoking and I’m worried my fiancé won’t be able to fall back asleep.

"TIFU by getting caught having sex in a pizza restaurant..
This happened right before the pandemic hit my country. I was 15 at the time and stupid. That day, I skipped school and decided to go to the mall with my boyfriend at the time. We spent the day in the mall doing cheesy couple stuff and then we decided to go to the pizza restaurant nearby, we were both hungry but not for the pizza, so we snuck into the bathroom and got at it.. halfway through, we hear a knock on the door. It's a female employee. Apparently, someone outside alerted them that we went in together and was in there a while. She demanded we open the door so we did, and she was standing there with 2 male employees behind her. I was standing there with no pants and this lady and the guys were yelling at us and refusing to let us close the door but thankfully my shirt was long enough to cover me up, my boyfriend slammed the door and helped me get my clothes on. The lady insisted that I give her my parents' number or she would call the police, I was in deep shit. Panicking, I gave her the phone number, and she called them and told them exactly what had happened.. another employee asked if she called the boy's parents too, and she said no, because she had to 'teach me a lesson'. My mom came and didn't say word to me, and then she dropped me off at my dad's house with all my stuff, we're on better terms now that I'm an adult.

I gently reminded her that she had to respect my autonomy and that we were working on boundaries and told her that yes, I was going to the festival. Her idea of a compromise was ""then I'm going with you for safety.""

Now, she has recently been diagnosed with Paranoid Personality Disorder, and she explained her fears very clearly - she's afraid I'll be hate crimed (either for being gay, Jewish, or both), afraid I'll be trampled to death, afraid someone will kidnap me or something. I did my best to explain to her that the party is very safe - it's not some random event, but something put together by the mayor's office, in collaboration with the departments of culture and turism. It's in a public place with not that many people, there's heavy police presence in addition to armed security patting everyone down (so nobody can sneak in weapons) and even the fire department was going to be present. Still, she responded with ""the people killed on October 7th also thought they were safe"", and, I mean, I couldn't argue with her there. I even made a point of not wearing my Star of David necklace in case there were some violent antisemites at the party. So I finally agreed to her coming with.

The whole time we were there she CLEARLY didn't want to be there and would rather be home. She just stood next to me with her arms crossed looking upset even when I tried to get her to dance. And then it happened.

Now, before I tell you what happened, I want to be clear: it was a safe event. We live in a small Stars Hollow-y town, and the event was big FOR OUR TOWN, but in the grand scheme of things it was virtually a block party. People took their little children to the festival. There were cops and firefighters everywhere. When compared to other Carnaval festivals, in the big city, it was probably the safest it can be. But there was ONE incident.

Some drunk guy groped a drunk woman who didn't want to be gropped, and she turned around and slapped him. He didn't like that and slapped her right back. From there they just started trading blows. It was ONE FIGHT, that got broken up by the cops within, like, a minute, and the two people were kicked out of the festival. ONE FIGHT. That was it.

Now here's where I might have fucked up. The fight happened about 4 meters away from us (roughly 13 feet). The moment we noticed it was happening, I immediately stepped up and put myself between the fight and my mom, pushing her behind me, and squared up in case either of them came our way. My mom was not happy with that. She kept tugging at me trying to get in front of me but I didn't let her.

After the fight was over, and the two drunks were kicked out, I turn around and she is glaring at me on the verge of tears. She straight up started crying, saying I put myself in danger and stopped her from protecting me. I gently tried to remind her that I'm a 6'2 (1.88 meters) large dude with relatively recent fighting experience (I've been sober for 12 years but before that I was a mean angry drunk and always got into fights, most times for fun) who took up Krav Maga after I quit drinking, and she's a tiny 5'2 (roughly 1.60 meters) old lady who hasn't been in a fight since middle school. She... Didn't take that well. She told me, through sobs, that it's her job to protect me, as the mom, and that I robbed her of that, and, even worse, put myself in harm's way.

That was last night and she is STILL upset about it today. Which has me second guessing my actions.","my mom insisted on accompanying me to a music festival, and when I tried to protect her when a fight happened near us she became incredibly upset about it and cried because I didn't let her protect me.","My mother went to a Carnaval festival with me and I was afraid I'd be harassed, attacked, and possibly kidnapped. It was a safe event, but she didn't want to be there."
"TIFU by uploading the wrong audio file for a school project
I just discovered my mistake and I am currently embarrassed. I’m currently enrolled online to complete my Master’s degree, and one of my classes assigned a group project to complete a hypothetical business pitch related to our degree. Part of the assignment was to complete a paper, and the other part was to complete a video presentation with PowerPoint slides. 

Our group was the biggest group, and it was harder to coordinate schedules between us. It got so difficult that we collectively decided for our presentation, we would split section responsibilities and each record an audio presentation of the sections we completed, embed that into our PowerPoint, and export it as a video to turn in. Seems simple enough.

I took multiple takes of my audio for the sections I completed, as I’m a big overthinker, and I decided I’d trim down a bad take for one of them rather than re-record it. I spent a decent time",,I uploaded the wrong audio file for a school project and now I'm embarrassed.
"TIFU by using chatgpt in a pinch
Few weeks ago my dumbass decided to use chat gpt in a literature class because I was extremely sick and didn't want to get the late penalty when I should've just took the L. Now the professor (whom is extremely strict about ai btw) wants to chat after class Monday. Fml. I know i fucked up but im scared as fuck and now that I'm better I realized I made such a stupid mistake. (I only used it to explain the story to me and give me examples of what my assignment with it should look like. I then used a mla template I usually always use but forgot to take out the title template because extremely sick and wasn't able to notice, I basically wrote everything and had it help extended to the word minimum. I realize it may have then accidentally combined the examples with my own work giving him the red-flag of ai)

I am so fucked and am praying I just get a zero and am not kicked out of class or expelled from college because of one stupid mistake, I've had a clean record before this and usually very good academicly. I'll never use chat gpt again. I don't even know what to say to him other than fess up and how do I proceed from here, as deflecting it will probably just make it worse. Like I know I fucked up bad and I won't do it again, he doesn't take any excuses either so like idk if itd even matter saying I was very sick I just should've just turned it in late when I felt better.","used ai in class while extremely sick to not lose points for being late, got a 0% and need to meet with super strict anti ai professor.

"TIFU by matching on a dating app with a woman who believes children are being kidnapped at Disney World and being trafficked to billionaires.
As a single professional millennial dude of course I’m on dating apps. Recently matched with a super cute red head that lives close by! (A rarity). We have mutual friends and are close in age, chatted for a few days, so when she friended me on FB I figured why not accept?

Then I saw the post. The post that said she was so happy Trump is deputizing all citizens to hunt child traffickers. I thought “hmmm that’s out of pocket”. So I asked her about it. She sent me a long message about how Jesus is working through Trump who is stopping celebrities from farming a youth elixir from children kidnapped from Disney World. Apparently Mickey Mouse is luring the children into the tunnels below the park? She continued to tell me about how she is already planning on going undercover into these organizations to save the children. As soon as I finished reading it she deleted the message. I so so so wish I got a screenshot. 

So I asked her about Trumps relationship with Epstein and that thankfully I did get a screenshot of. She wrote-

“You're taking news at face value without doing the footwork to find out what else was going on. The things that keep me up at night, and going to war every day, are not the same things for you. And thats ok. If we see things differently. Epstwins island, I believe, is for trafficked humans to be sacrificed and cut up and had sex with and then permanently destroyed. Missing forever. That's a cult. A deep state cult. And Trump has dismantled it. His work is speaking for him. You're reminding ne of his past, I'm reminding you of our future.
Thats our president put some respect on his name.”

After reading that I blocked her of course but not before she told me I could find out what she said is true if I go to the “dark web”. Since she knows my full name and was friends with me on FB she now knows where I live, my family, what I drive, and… probably thinks I’m part of the conspiracy.",I accepted a Facebook friend request from a woman I met on a dating app who is convinced there’s a conspiracy by the rich to farm children from Disney World for their “fluids”.,Met a girl on a dating app who believes children are being kidnapped at Disney World and being trafficked to billionaires.

"TIFU by calling out my coworker for cheating on his fiancé with my friend
This event happened a little over a month ago, and while things at work have settled down, and I admit I made a mistake, I still don't feel resolved about everything. 

I have worked with my (25f) coworker (27f) since 2023. We were always friendly, but I didn't start getting close with her until we started working together in the same classroom this year. 
About 6 months ago, a new guy started working at our school site, he was great with the kids and attractive, but I heard offhand that he had a fiancé. I didn't think much of it until a few months, one of the teachers in my classroom commented that my coworker, let's call her Ella, and my new coworker, Sam, would make a great couple as they stood side by side talking during a work potluck. 
I mentioned ""I thought Sam has a fiancé?"" But my coworker assured me that he did not. 

Another coworker (3 of us outside Ella) was also in on the scoop and I mentioned the same comment I overheard, that Sam had a fiancé, but she also debunked it saying, ""I never heard anything about that.""

It was few weeks after this that Ella and I started communicating outside of work and I learned more about her life, which was very tragic. The more I learned about her, the more I liked and admired her, but I also learned that she had some pretty intense anxiety for good reason. 

It became shared knowledge between my other two co-workers that we were rooting for Ella and Sam to get together. After winter break, Ella told me that she and Sam had been texting and meeting up before work for 3 months, and expressed anxiety about our work place finding out. 

I didn't realize they had gotten to that stage of talking and confirmed to her that it wasn't obvious at all, and that our workplace probably wouldn't be very strict about fraternization. 

She continued to go on about how seriously Sam took this policy, and about how he didn't want things to become serious because of the risk to his job. It made Ella very anxious and stressed out to the point she told me she wanted to end things over it. I told her that the risk of something bad happening probably wasn't worth the risk of ending something possibly good, and for her to make sure it wasn't underlying fears that made her want to end things. She told me she was certain on breaking stuff off because if anything happened to Sam's job, she would feel terrible. 
I supported her in her decision, but she later told me when I followed up about it that, ""he didn't let me lol"".  

Shortly after this, my first coworker called me in a tizzy because of something concerning she had heard. She had spoken to another male co-worker about how his relationship with his wife (both work on site with us) was effected by the no-fraternizing policy. This male co-worker, quick to decuce the reasoning for this line of questioning, asked if this had anything to do with Sam and Ella. My coworker said, ""what if it did?"" And the male coworker says seriously that he has it on good authority that Sam is engaged, and that he has spoken to Sam directly about the engagement. 

My coworker, distressed, talks to both me and my other co-worker about it, and how, if it's true, will we tell Ella who is anxious? I voted that we tell her directly, but my two coworkers didn't want to upset her and instead decided that they would ""tell her to create distance because of conflicting work issues"" and not mention the unconfirmed potential fiancé. 

That decision didn't sit well with me, but my attempts to convince my coworker to do otherwise didn't work so I agreed not to say anything about it. 
Until the next day during the weekend, Ella excitedly tells me that she asked Sam out on a date and it went really well!! I tried to act positive about it, but it felt so disgustingly fake that I had to say something along the lines of ""I don't want to say anything, but I think you should pursue this relationship carefully."" Which brought out a round of ""wait, why would you say that? Did something happened?"" I told her I didn't want to say, but then she said she was ""freaking out, please tell me I thinking the worse"" and I told her about what we SUSPECTED but didn't know for sure. She became understandably upset and said if it was true she ""would never be able to show her face at work again"" and that she would talk to Sam about it. 

I also informed my coworker that I messed up and ""spilled the beans"" and she essentially sighed and shrugged. 

I felt pretty awful on both counts, one that I didn't keep to my agreement, and two that I needlessly stressed out Ella who needed no additional stress in her life. 

Ella later texted me and said she spoke with Sam and ""no, he's single"" and I was suspicious but expresses that I was relieved for her. 

Come Monday, my worker texts me the morning before I came in that she had news to discuss with my other coworker and I in person. She found pictures of Sam's wedding registry for April, and a picture of him holding a ""sold"" sign with his fiancé in front of their house. 

I felt absolutely sick with anger, just furious because how freaking dare he. I have big old fashioned ideals about truth, loyalty and justice, and the idea of Sam conning both his fiancé and my friend made me see red. My coworkers were just in shock and they wanted to ""not say anything and stay out of their business"" while I insisted that Ella deserved to know. They didn't want to stress her out and they also didn't want her to know they had been doing some digging behind their back. I don't remember expressly agreeing to this, but in the light of how much I stressed Ella out the first time I mentioned anything, I decided not to tell her directly. 

That day, Sam came into our class to work with the kids and I felt so full of anger towards him. I thought about following him outside to speak with him directly but dismissed it. 

Later, after coming out of the restroom, I saw him walking with his ""student"" someone he's training in his position, and without having any idea what the heck I planned to say, I jogged over to him. 

I spoke very positively and casually to him, and the moment is seared in my mind so I think I have the conversation close to word for word. 

""Hi Sam! Can I speak with you for a moment?""

He agrees and faces me, with his student standing a few paces away. I consider asking him to speak privately but that seemed like making it a ""big deal"". In hindsight I wish I had asked to speak privately.. 

Dude, I can't believe how bullheadedly I handled this conversation, but this is how it went. 

""Do you know, (fiancés name) Cass?""
""Who?""
""Cass.""
""Cass (last name)?""
""Yes.""
""Yeah I know her..""
""Is she your fiancé?""
""What?""
""Is she your fiancé?""
""Yes... how did you-""
""I looked up your wedding registry, you're getting married in April?""
""Oh yeah.."" confused chuckling 
""Congratulations!""
""Thank you-""
""Does Ella know?""
Dead silence, the smile drops from his face, he stares intently at me for like 3 seconds. I stare hard back, I am fueled by self righteous anger. 
""No...""
""She should know.""
More silence then he says without breaking eye contact-
""We need to talk.""
""We're talking right now."" 
""No, Ella and I need to talk.""
I think I said something like ""that's a good idea, thanks for talking with me"" and he says ""you're welcome"" and without looking at his student who has been standing awkwardly behind Sam this whole time, I walk slowly back to my class, my heart slamming and my hands shaking. 

I go back to class feeling so out of it, like I couldn't even comprehend what I just did. 

I look back and co-worker number 2 and she can tell by the look on my face that something's up, and I just shake my head. Later I admit I spoke to Sam and she is flipping out, laughing and getting excited. Her positive reaction makes me feel a little less freaked out about it, and after I explain exactly what I said to both of them, they both cheer me on ""you're my hero"" and that I handled it well. 

Welp, an hour later Ella comes up to me, anxious af saying ""did you talk to Sam?"" I'm stunned then I notice coworker number 2 behind her looking somber. I said yes and she makes a gasp of shock and horror. She asked about what I said, and I told her that it would be best if she heard it directly from him. She asked if I mentioned her name, and I shamefacedly admitted to that as well. She leaves in a fluster and I feel dread down to my stomach the entire day. I apologize to her during my class afterwork to which she replies, ""I'm not angry at you, I just wish you hadn't used my name"" I apologized more, feeling like an absolutely idiot, she never replies. Coworker number 2 texts to ask if I'm okay, I admit I feel stressed and stupid for messing up, and she leaves me on read. 

I stress about the whole scenario all night long, I talk to my family and my best friend about it and they said while my heart was in the right place, I shouldn't have interfered and not to let it get to me. 

I was so upset about what happened, I didn't sleep and it wasn't until about 6 AM that I stopped guilt tripping myself and realized, if I was in Ella's shoes, I did what I would have wanted a friend to do for me. Yeah I probably shouldn't have said anything, and if I could take it back I would, but I acted according to my morals. It helped me feel much more centered. 

Sometime during my anxiety ridden night, I had texted coworker 1 about how awful I felt, and that morning she asked if I would like to call and talk about it. I already felt much calmer and agreed, but when she called me, she spent 20 minutes telling me a story about she messed up with a friend and how she felt terrible, but that she learned from the experience e in the long run. 

10 minutes into that conversation, I was shocked that she didn't really mention her involvement at all, didn't ask me about how I felt, and somehow turned this whole fiasco into a reflection of a lesson she had already learned. She told me to let Ella come to me, and that she would forgive me eventually. I told her I appreciated her and her story, and left it at that, but I felt let down by our conversation. 

The day at work, no one spoke to me about what happened, and the same thing happened the following day. And the rest of the week, and the following week. 

I felt like I had lost 3 friendships that day. I felt a little bit like a social pariah even though no one did anything to really exclude me. We just all pretended like it didn't happen, but they continued to talk about it, just without me. 

A few weeks later, I finally reached out to Ella to apologize for overstepping, she said she wasn't mad, and that Sam really was single and that he lied to me about being engaged because he was put on the spot. (Coworker 1 had shown Ella pictures of Sam with his fiancé so I don't know how she played that off). She said she also hoped what happened wouldn't affect my view of him. I told her I respected him in a professional manner, but either he was a cheater or a liar and either way I didn't respect him as a person. She never responded and that was the end of it. 

I ended up looking up the wedding registry later in the hopes of being able to contact his fiancé and let her know the situation, after being advised to by my close friends, but Sam had locked it, and taken down their photo. And I was never able to find his fiancés social so I just let the matter lie. 

As of now, over a month later, Sam and I don't make eye contact and my coworkers and I don't talk about it, but it still weighs heavy on me feeling like I lost something special with all 3 of these people, because I no longer trust them.","I ruined my coworkers courtship with another coworker after I found out he had a fiancée, by confronting him.","I called out my coworker for cheating on his fiancé with my friend, but I still don't feel resolved about everything."
"TIFU by thinking my mom found her birthday present early and freaking out
Hi, so this is one of my first real reddit posts ever so i hope i did this right, tifu big time in my opinion. Some backstory is that my whole family but mostly my mom have been going through a really rough time in the last year and her birthday is coming up so i wanted to surprise her with a massage gift card, which when you make what i do isnt cheap, but i love her and wanted to treat her. So, today after work i stopped by and picked one up and a card to go with it and me and my little sister set it up when i got home. Well i guess i didn't realize, but the gift card i guess came in a little envelope of its own and i accidentally left it out on the counter. Cut to my mom making dinner and she finds it. I had put the card away in my stuff right next to her so when she said hey whats this ""insert random massage place"" thing, i think ""oh no she went through my stuff and opened her card"" so i start freaking out. Ill be honest i did yell but mostly in a WTF kind of way. After that i realized that she didn't go through my stuff but i was still under the impression that the surprise was already ruined. So now im upset and asking my sister if we should just give it to her now in a looking back on it now probably a not super nice tone, and all hell breaks loose from there, everyone is yelling at each other.

So to preface this story I have some friends on the internet who say a lot of stuff that I don't fully get all the time, a lot of these references usually make me sound smarter and wittier when I make jokes in public but this time around when I saw my brother's son getting absolutely demolished in his little league game this did not work out in my favor. After he hit a home run I thought to myself ""oh shit he's going to make a comeback"" and to sound witty and to sound like I know stuff about the world I shouted that this is his coming weimar moment. My brother and his wife looked at me very strangely, after this I felt quite embarrassed and knew immediately that I said something I shouldn't have. Once his little league game was done me and my brother and his wife awkwardly walked back to our cars sharing a few words to each other but ultimately silently getting into our cars.

Today I 20M in college, got a notification from google photos and it was one of those “Remember 2020” slide shows with videos and photos from 2020.

"TIFU by saying ""I love you"" to a friend
Male, 32, gay, a first generation immigrant living in the US.

The culture and language I come from, we show affection to everyone. Strangers even. Those we consider friends, it's common to say we love them.

I've lived in the US for 11 years and it hasn't computed in my brain that this is not the norm here.

Called another older (much much older) gay friend to wish him a happy birthday. We had a good chat. I ended the conversation with *I love you.* 

**AND THERE WAS A PAUSE.** And the pause followed with, ""*Love to you too*"" from the other side.

That pause bugged me. I told my husband what happened. He rolled his eyes and chuckled, and said, ""**We don't say I love you** to our friends here, **unless we're very very close, and even that is weird between men.**""

I was flabbergasted. Husband says I need to clarify this to my friend because I've made things awkward. I think I'm just going to hide under the covers and hope the awkwardness dissipates.

Also really bummed that English isn't as affectionate of a language.

"TIFU I invited my Girlfriend at my home and got caught by my grandmother.
Adding NSFW just in case...

Things you need to know before starting with the story:
1. My parents are not home for a few days
2. My parents don't know about my relationship(They maybe chill about the whole relationship stuff but I don't know for sure)


So, my parents were gone for a few days. Total freedom. Or so I thought. My girlfriend(21F) and I(21M) were getting a little cozy on the terrace, you know, the usual kissing and whatnot, when we realized the lack of privacy was a real buzzkill. Normally, we’d just hop in my parents' car, but they’d taken it. So, my girlfriend, bless her, suggested we go to my place. ""Grandma's there,"" I said, but, well, men will be men, and the idea of a little alone time was too tempting.
I cooked up this ""genius"" plan. I'd distract Grandma, and my girlfriend would sneak into my room. We decided to stay connected on a phone call and I'd distract my grandma and once I'msure that my grandma is distracted I'd hang up the phone call and that'd be the signal for my girlfriend to rush to my room. I went inside, flipping off the main lights to avoid the security cameras(We have security cameras at home for security reasons). Grandma was chilling in the living room, scrolling through YouTube. I faked a ""Are the bathroom lights working good"" reason and dragged her to her room as I had installed new lights in her bathroom recently. As soon as we were in, I hung up the phone – that was the signal.
We walked back to the living room, and I saw my room door was a tiny bit more closed than before. Sweet, she(my gf) made it. Then, bam, my phone rang. I answered it, flipped the main lights back on, and... chaos.
My grandma was peering around, checking if someone had come in. And in that split second, she spotted my girlfriend, hiding behind the door. Literally, seven seconds. Seven. Seconds. My grandma just laughed and asked, ""What are you doing, beta?"" My girlfriend was mortified. I panicked, pretending she needed A4 paper for a project. A freaking A4 paper!
Grandma, bless her, just said, ""Sit, I'll go to my room, you guys can work on your project."" My girlfriend, who's a total sweetheart, was mortified. We sat down, and it was like, ""Okay, we're not fooling anyone."" So, we confessed. We told her we wanted to watch TV and talk, but we were too chicken to ask.
And then, Grandma just dropped the bomb. ""It's okay, I understand. It's your age."" I was stunned. She literally said ""The heart wants what it wants"" . She said she understood the feelings and that it would stay between us. I had no idea she was so cool about this stuff.
My girlfriend left, and I went back to talk to Grandma. She reiterated that she understood and that it was our age. I still don't know if she's just playing it cool until my parents get back, but for now, it's like a weird, awkward truce. I mean, who knew my grandma was so open-minded? It was a total TIFU, but also, surprisingly, kind of sweet? Just hoping this doesn’t blow up when mom and dad come home.","Tried to sneak my girlfriend into my house for some privacy while my grandma was home.

"TIFU by taking a high dose of edibles and scaring myself off weed forever
My partner and I were on vacation in a state where weed isn’t illegal, so before we left our home state (where it is legal), we stocked up on some edibles. He has a pretty high tolerance, so he picked out a strong chocolate and peanut butter candy bar, while I went for some gummies. We forgot to take them the entire trip, leaving us with only our last night to indulge.

That last night, I decided to try a bite of his chocolate bar. It was delicious—too delicious. One bite turned into a couple more, and before I knew it, I had eaten at least half the bar. The problem? Dosing chocolate is tricky. I had anywhere between 40 mg and, horrifyingly, the full 100 mg.

About an hour and a half later, it hit me. Hard.

By this time, my partner had already passed out on the hotel couch. I woke him up and suggested we go to bed. As soon as I lay down, I started twitching, a familiar sensation for me when I’m too high. But this time, something was different. The twitching wasn’t just a random jerk here and there. It felt violent, like I had lost control of my body. My heart pounded in my chest like a drum in a horror movie, and my anxiety skyrocketed to a level I had never experienced before.

Now, I deal with anxiety regularly, but this? This felt like something else. Instead of my usual spiraling thoughts, it felt like there were voices in my head: loud, aggressive, external voices, all screaming at me at once. My mind was a chaotic battlefield, every insecurity and responsibility crashing down on me like an avalanche. My job. My family. My car. My house. My cats. My relationship. My existence. Every single aspect of my life felt like it was being scrutinized and picked apart by some unseen force, and I couldn’t shut it off.

Then, the worst part: I couldn’t tell if I was actually twitching or if it was all in my head. I kept trying to convince myself it was just paranoia, that I wasn’t actually convulsing. But then my partner turned to me, his face bewildered and concerned.

“Are you okay? You’re shaking.”

Panic flooded my system. It was real. It wasn’t just in my head. I was physically shaking, and I couldn’t stop. My voice was trembling when I told him, “No, I think I’m having a panic attack or a heart attack or something.”

Cue full-on crisis mode. We tried everything, wrapping me in blankets in case I was cold (spoiler: I wasn’t, probably idk), turning up the heat, my partner holding me, talking me through my anxiety. Nothing worked. My body felt like it was burning from the inside out, like fire was coursing through my nerves and exploding at the ends. My voice shook so badly that even trying to explain what was happening felt impossible.

At some point, either through sheer exhaustion or my brain short-circuiting, I finally managed to fall asleep. But the nightmare wasn’t over.

I woke up still high. And I mean still high. Not a gentle, fading buzz. I was wrecked for sixteen hours straight. Every thought still felt distant and warped, my body sluggish and disconnected. I got cold very easily, my head was pounding, my sight felt disconnected from by brain.

That experience scared me off weed forever. I don’t want to smoke it. I don’t want to eat it. Hell, I don’t even like that my partner still smokes because even the smell of it now makes my lungs feel like they’re closing up. So, yeah. That was fun.",- Took too high of a dosage of edibles and definitely will be avoiding all THC products like the plague.,Took a high dose of edibles and scaring myself off weed forever.
"TIFU by siding with a horrible person over all of my friends, family and loved ones
There’s this girl and she absolutely sucks. She is a pain in the ass and I seriously cannot stand to be around her for more than 5 minutes. My eye literally starts twitching every time she speaks. She only cares about herself and no one else. She is trying to pursue a career in music and leaves aside education and treats everybody like a fan. She is such a bad influence for me and I despise her. Her behavior contrats with every value I have and I just genuinely dislike the idea of having her around. She tosses people around, treats romance and love like a game and play with the feelings of every person she meets, whether she likes them or not, whether it is romantically or not. She went after every boy her girlfriends liked and was abandoned by every person in her life. Everyone hates her, and every single person I know tried to warn me about all of the above. I didn’t listen. I chose to ignore everything because she seemed so nice, and she never wronged me. My intuition tried to save me from this hell of a “friendship” and I didn’t listen. Now she thinks she is a close friend of mine and I feel completely miserable. She is trying so hard to include herself into my friend group, making daily life awkward and uncomfortable and is also trying to seduce the boy I used to date. It all just makes me despise her even more. I feel so dumb and stuck. The only option for me to end this nightmare is to be a hypocrite and be extremely cruel to her, with the intention of pushing her away forever, even though it goes against my principles and I just feel so damn bad. I know it is not nearly as serious as other stories in here, but I really fucked up and I will never doubt my loved ones or my intuition ever again.

TL,DR: People tried to warn me about annoying girl with bad intentions and I didn’t listen. It all backfired and now I can’t escape this reality without betraying my principles. 

ps: I do not intend on discussing it on comments or keeping an eye on this post’s repercussions, as this is just a venting post. Please do not feel offended if I do not reply to you 🤍",,"TIFU by siding with a horrible person over all of my friends, family and loved ones."
"TIFU: By putting “BJs” for two hours on my calendar at work
So this just happened about two hours ago, and I'm really feeling the shame, so I figured I'd share with all of you children who will be equally amused and embarrassed for me (and my wife).

So I recently got a promotion at work, and with it comes a shared administrative assistant. The admin,  among other things, can help schedule, move, and cancel meetings for me. To do this, she has access to my calendar and can see all my meetings. 

My wife and I have a membership to a few wholesale clubs, including BJs and Costco. On Friday, my wife wants me to go with her to both so we can get stuff for a party we're having this weekend.

Well my dumb ass went into my calendar last night and blocked off two hours on my own calendar for Friday with the simple title of ""BJs.""

Obviously you can see where this is going, but my new admin pinged me today and we had the following convo:

Her: ""Reminder: I can see your calendar now."" 

Me: ""Yep, I remember! But thanks for the reminder anyway!""

Her: ""And that means I can also see all the meetings you add yourself.""

Me (still not realizing): ""Yep, got it.""

Her: ""So I can see the meeting you put on your calendar for Friday at lunch.

Me: .... oh god .... ""Holy crap! I'm so sorry! My wife and I are going to Costco and BJs and I blocked off two hours to run some errands! I promise!!""

Her: ""LOL - you can do whatever you want want on your free time. Just thought I'd remind you.""

I don't think she believes me and now will be super embarrassed every time I talk to or see her. 

Yikes.","I blocked off two hours for ""BJs"" (the wholesale club) on my work schedule forgetting that my new admin can see my meetings, who undoubtedly thinks I meant ""BJs"" with my wife.","I blocked off two hours of my free time to go to Costco and BJs with the simple title of ""BJs."""

"TIFU by trying to DIY my eyebrows before a big meeting
So, today I decided I’d save some time and money by shaping my own eyebrows before a huge work presentation. I’m usually pretty decent with makeup, so I figured, how hard could it be to tweeze a little here and there? Famous last words.

I started off fine, but then I got a little too confident with the tweezers. I kept thinking, “Just one more hair,” until I stepped back and realized one eyebrow was basically a skinny little tadpole while the other was still bushy. Panic set in. I tried to even them out, but it was like playing a losing game of eyebrow Jenga every pluck made it worse.

In a desperate move, I grabbed an old eyebrow pencil to fill them in, but it was this cheap one I hadn’t used in years, and it turned out to be a weird reddish-brown shade. So now I’m rocking one pencil-thin brow and one patchy, auburn monstrosity. I had to Zoom into this meeting looking like I’d lost a fight with a lawnmower, and my boss kept giving me this confused side eye the whole time.

Minor tifu but a tifu non the less.

For context: i have been getting adjusted to a new job while also looking for another job since the first job isnt going so well because of the work times so I'm a tad scatterbrained at times.

"TIFU by eating Dates
This is actively happening right now.

TJMaxx has these little almond-rolled dates, they are delicious. I didn't know I liked Dates this much. They have 7g of fiber. I've eaten at least 8 date balls today, probably closer to 10 or 11.

My guts hurt.

I'm at work and today I'm answering phones and checking people in so running to the bathroom is a difficulty. I am a 30 year old woman and my daily fiber intake is something like 24grams. I've had anywhere between 8-11, maybe more, dates. That's a minimum of 49g of fiber.

I've been in and out of the toilet all afternoon.

And, I've drunk like 50oz of water today so the bathroom is my home now. I'm miserable and it feels like there are little bouncy balls flying around my guts.

"TIFU by Trying Contacts
This just happened this morning. I was on a routine appointment to the eye doctor after I noticed my vision was getting worse. I hadn't been able to read road signs from far away, etc. When I arrived in the office everything went as normal. Pictures and measurements were taken, but I did find it difficult to keep my eyes open during the pressure check. (The one where they touch your eye with the tonometer). After that, I went into a different room so they could sort out my prescription. 

After the doctor finished, he asked me if I wanted to try contacts. I was slightly apprehensive about it, but I thought ""What the hell, why not?"" A nurse came in, and began trying to put the contact in my eye. However, I struggled to keep my eyes open, making it difficult for her to put it in. After they got the first one in, I could tell my vision had improved on the one side. However, this vision difference made me extremely dizzy, and as they were attempting to put in the second one, my vision began to cloud. A monochrome pattern was creeping into my vision, making it so I couldn't see a thing. The next thing I knew, I was sitting slumped over in the exam chair, with 4 people standing over me.

It turned out that due to the stress of having something put in my eye, I had passed out for a few seconds and turned deathly pale. I drank about 3 bottles of water, but I'm still not feeling great. There's a little bit of nausea and a headache, but hopefully, some rest and more water will help.","I became dizzy and passed out at the eye doctor after a nurse tried to put contacts in, likely due to stress.","Tried to put a contact in my eye, got dizzy and passed out."
"TIFU by making a pen go through my hand
This TIFU happend 8 years ago when I was in high school. 

One day after a recess I went into my classroom with a friend, the teacher wasn't there so we sat down in our chairs and started playing like if we were having a knife fight with pens.

In a moment I pretended to jump out of my chair to the floor. I don't know how or why the pen ended up with the tip up and I fell with all the weight of my body on it. This caused it to literally go through my hand, but fortunately the pen did not touch any veins, arteries, nerves or anything else, so no blood came out and I did not lose mobility in my hand or fingers, everything is as normal as before that event. After this I just stood up and went to the teachers room and waited to an ambulance.

The main problem was that I played football in a club as a goalkeeper and I was 3 weeks unable to play or go training because the scar could suffer an infection. My dad and my coach scolded me so much that now I see pens as deadly weapons.",pretending to fight with a friend while sitting I jumped out of my chair to the floor with a pen that went through my hand and I couldn't play football for 3 weeks.,Made a pen go through my hand 8 years ago.
"TIFU: by not holding the door
Yesterday, actually. It was a gusty-windy day and I was leaving Walmart. I had my kiddo with me and his car seat takes a good two handed tug to tighten the straps. 

So while I was buckling him in, the wind was calm and I let go of my car door to get him secured. Of course, as soon as I do a rogue gust of wind grabs my door and slams it into the car next to me. It didn't seem to have hit THAT hard, so I wasn't too worried but I felt pretty bad. I finished bucking in my kid.

When I inspected the damage, my door had gouged the paint and left a dent about 3 inches across in the door that I hit.

I checked 3 times that my door had actually done that much damage and all the marks lined up. Guilty. I couldn't in good conscience leave without leaving my contact info.

As I was writing a note to leave on the car the owner came out and I explained what had happened. She took my info, and we agreed she'd get some quotes before I decided to run it through my insurance or just cut a check.

Welp, first quote came back today: $2500. It was from a dealership but it's about 4x higher than I expected.

"TIFU going on a walk..
Tifu by going on a walk. 

This all started about 4 days ago when my husband and I went on a trip, I unfortunately have a very hard time going to the bathroom when we’re away from home, I just can’t produce a number 2 away from home. Sometimes the different sound of the fan bothers me or the noise from the hallway, whatever it is I get backed up. 

This is very unlike me as I have IBS and my bathroom and I see each other at least 4 times a day, but I can be in the bathroom some days 6-8 times in a day. When we got home Sunday I was in agony so I downed some fiber gummies and for good measure I added in some prunes and prune juice. I made it through the night with absolutely no relief. Now home and back in my normal routine I leashed up my dogs and went out for a walk. 

My dogs and I made it to our usual turning back point, a dead end in an undeveloped part of our neighborhood, when it hit me. 

My gut screamed and turned. I felt four days of waste doing cartwheels in my gut when
The sharpest pain I have ever felt hit me. My body ran hot and I felt chills engulf me.

I. Was. Going. To. Crap. My. Pants.

Fear set in and I started to bolt home. 
I knew 4 days of Taco Bell, Gas station snacks, and take out was coming back to haunt me and I was still 3/4 of the way home so I start running.
 
I still have my dogs with me and they’re suddenly taken aback by my uptake in speed. Another fatal mistake; 
My youngest Dog, Bless his heart, attempts to jump and play. His 75lb body bounces off me and it takes me down. I fall to the ground and that split second of panic and fear as I fall…it causes me to loose control I feel it happen in slow motion. I crapped my pants. 

I’m nearly half way back home on my neighbors lawn with my dog attempting to play with me as I lay there now joined by the four days of mistakes and regrets… This isn’t wear the tifu ends though. 
I was faced with a decision try and walk home in soiled pants with this turd in pants? No. I take myself to my neighbors drive way where his trash cans are and I slide my underwear down in my sweatpants yes-turd along with it. 
I grab a dog poop bag off my leash and bag it and I throw the turd and soiled underwear in his bin. 

I cry as I slowly walk home and when I called my husband to tell him what happened 
He laughs hysterically and then informs me that I will need to talk to him when he gets home because I’m going to have to tell our neighbor what happened. He tell me the neighbors trash bin is going to be rancid; it will smell, and I can’t leave soiled shit underwear in his trash can, fuck he’s right. I didn’t think about that. 

Part of me wants to pretend this day never happened, but now all of you know what happened and when my neighbor gets home I have to walk over explain what happened and offer to pay to have the bin cleaner clean out his bins.","I over dosed myself on fiber gummies

"TIFU by answering a random phone call
I (22 F) recently received a phone call that has me fully invested, but also partially terrified.

I was sitting in my bed earlier this afternoon just minding my own business when I suddenly received a phone call with my local area code. I wasn’t expecting any calls or anything, but I decided that I would answer it after debating. It wasn’t tagged as a spam caller, so I thought maybe it’d be something pertaining to me that might be important. So, I answer it.

“Is Devin (all fake names) with you?”

Confused and alone in my room, I say “…no?” I have a coworker named Devin so I thought maybe that would be who she was talking about, which is why I didn’t say I didn’t know him in the first place.

“I know he’s with you, don’t lie to me.”

Scared, I decide to hang up thinking it’s a robocaller or something. I don’t like talking on the phone in the first place and feel more anxious talking to people that way, so this was instinctual.

My phone rings again. “Hello…?”

I proceed to get absolutely bombarded with angry yelling saying I was a liar, he was with me and she knew it, and that I knew exactly what she was talking about. Me, obviously extremely confused, tells her I don’t know who Devin is and that I think she has the wrong number, but that I hoped she found who she was looking for. She continues to yell over me telling her she has the wrong number for like five full minutes.

At one point, I tell her straight up that it cannot be me because first of all, the last time I had a boyfriend was before I realized I was a lesbian at least five years ago. 

“Oh you’re a lesbian? Okay, so it’s a throuple situation!” Crazy response to that but okay?

She also kept saying it was suspicious that I answered again and that I didn’t answer her question during the first call or immediately block her number.

I will admit, I was way too nice, only because I was scared she’d hunt me down bc of the seriousness in her tone lmfao. I just kept telling her I am not who she thinks I am, and she keeps calling me Alexis. I tell her “No, my name is Tori (not my name)” and she just will not believe me. I tell her I will ‘legit facetime her right now to prove I’m not lying’ which she agreed to, but it wouldn’t let me because she wasn’t recognized in my contacts. So instead, I sent her a picture of myself via text and hung up after telling her this. 

The response:

“okay well i’m very sorry then like I said.”

me: all good! hope you find who you’re looking for.

“seriously I’m sorry if I got the wrong person and thank you thank you”

I even gave her my instagram! But at this point I don’t block her because I’m fully invested. I don’t know who Alexis is, but her ass is grass. She sounded angry as HELL, so I didn’t block her and lowkey wanted to ask her in a few days if she found her because I’m nosy lmfao.

An hour later, I go to my friend’s house and her and another friend say I was being WAY too nice and even threatened to call her themselves, but I don’t want the smoke so I told her I could handle it. But literally as we started talking about it again, she calls. I again say “…hello?”

Silence.

Then a text.

“you know i still don't believe you. i know it's an open relationship and all but don't be a liar come on now.”

If there are any updates I will let you guys know, but I once again told her that I am telling the truth and am also awaiting on hearing the Alexis and Devin situation.","Don’t answer random phone calls and then immediately hang up when you get confused, or else suddenly you’re paranoid that you are living a double life as a woman named Alexis who has a man named Devin in her house.",I answered a random phone call and now I’m not sure what to do.
"TIFU by being a paranoid horror nut
Today I (F24) fucked up by being a paranoid little horror nut who simply cannot help but put fiction into my own reality. 

So this just happened. It is 5 o’clock in the morning, I’m laying in bed next to my husband scrolling Reddit after having woken up because of what I can only slightly remember being a home invasion nightmare. I have tried, unsuccessfully, to get to sleep several times in the past hour but every time I try my brain puts up stupid images of some unknown crazed stranger scaling our apartment building and climbing on to our balcony to stare creepily through our sliding glass door (which just so happens to be right next to our bed, who made that stupid design call???) so I am up, paranoid and butt naked (I always sleep butt naked as I find it most comfortable lol this IS relevant later), all I can think of is scenes from every horror movie I’ve ever watched and every line from a creepypasta that scared me shitless when I was in my teens. 

Suddenly, I hear two loud quick knocks on the door, I freak out and wake my husband (took several shakes cause he sleeps like a dead horse, lord help us if something ACTUALLY happens haha) and he groggily goes and checks the door through the peephole and comes back telling me no one’s there and it was probably just the wind throwing around our little welcome sign. He’s probably right, that sign does knock about when it’s windy but of course my brain is convinced that it was actually some creepy skin and bones man that is clearly just hiding out of sight (whhhyyyy do I do this to myself??) so I am still awake shitting bricks. 

Eventually I hear more noises (in retrospect probably just tree branches shaking and the sounds of our neighbor waking up and getting ready for an early shift) and I’m like I got this, I’m gonna look around the entire apartment this time. So I get up, flash light in hand, and check every room, closet, bathroom and of course the front door and balcony. Obviously there’s nothing. So I walk my naked self back to bed as quietly as I can manage and then I see it, some pale faced creature in my bed, eyes dark and trained on me, my body tenses and I let out a small scream and…a defense fart? Louder than it usually would be because I have no pants to muffle the sound. It is only after I release my self defense honk that I realize…it is not a demon or a ghost or whatever my movie addled brain thought, it was my husband squinting at me. He had been woken up when I got out of bed and had been sitting up waiting for me to come back and unknowingly scared the flatulence out of me upon my return. 

“What the fuck are you doing?” He had asked, he definitely sounded annoyed and exhausted. 

I laughed nervously as I came back to bed and said “your face scared me I guess” 

He grunted and rolled over “you’re weird”

"TIFU by asking my ex who I'm still legally married to for a divorce via text
I haven't lived with my ex wife in two years. In fact I've bought a home of my own. We share custody of a child with no major issue, she lives in our old house, we effectively live as a divorce would be. It works for us and we've both expressed to each other we felt no need to change it.

I'm in a relationship. It bothers her that I am still married. If I want this relationship to be more serious I need to get a divorce. This is understandable. I've decided I do want to be more serious. I don't want to remarry, necessarily, but I want it clear I want the next level and I'm not fucking around.

The thought occurred to me this morning. I discussed this with no one. I sent my ex wife a text: would you be okay with me seriously pursuing a divorce? Getting a lawyer? I'll pay the legal fees, you can have the house, I trust you to pay the mortgage so you can keep my name on that mortgage with the sweet, sweet interest rate. I'm the one asking for it, so I'll avoid any hardship on her resulting from it. 

She asked why. I told the truth. The fact I'm doing it with another woman in mind may have stung. Then again her love life has been interesting since the split and she kinda name drops often enough I think. And she knows I'm in this relationship. 

My ex wife doesn't appreciate me blindsiding her via text during her workday. I really, really know her well enough to know better. I thought favorable terms would be welcome news but she really was thinking of keeping on keeping on. I could easily walk this back as I haven't told anyone my intentions yet, but I mean I do want it.

"TIFU by trying to support a local business
This happened a few months ago, where I live. We have our own sort of local version of ubereats or just eat. Most take away on her. Had a minimum price you had to order before getting any delivery. One local place used to have no minimum order so you could order anything over 0 lb and you'll get a delivery. I loved this takeaway they were the only place I could buy Hershey's kisses and they had their own milkshakes and ice cream. They also gave me extra sweets in my bag so I really enjoyed their service. One day I wanted an ice cream from there so opened the app and saw that their minimum order value has gone up to 15 lb and that their menu was a lot smaller, I was worried as last time this happened the restaurant that happened to shut down a few weeks later. I really loved this takeaway so I decided to take to Facebook to try and get them some more support to get more money so they could continue their business in case it was going out of business or something. I posted my concerns on a local Facebook group tagging the delivery app and the restaurant immediately. I started getting loads of nasty comments. People were missed reading my post and thinking that I meant it was 15 lb delivery fee which I didn't mean at all and they were accusing me of wanting the business to shut down and driving people away from it.

"TIFU by dropping a marketplace bike
My husband and I (20F) went and checked out a 2022 kawasaki ninja 650 being sold on market place. I used to ride a yamaha r3 and I’m quite comfortable on a street bike. Theres a new 2025 r3 we were looking at but seemed too much money for what its capable of. So we decided to look at this one that was less money and more powerful. 

We get there and its a woman on the bike and her man. I look at it, seems nice. And I ask to test it. Now for reference, I’m a 5”0 girl. So I guess in the riding world I can look like a joke. I sat on the bike and I can just enough touch the ground. I have road my friends bike, exact same one. The difference is he did more to it and the things tuned to be more powerful than these peoples one. But it was lowered. When they let me test it, they seemed unsure and I kept saying repeatedly if they aren’t comfortable its totally alright. I truly did feel comfortable at first, but I think as I started moving the nerves of them all hard staring at me got to me. Well like a dumb dumb. As I was moving forward tryna get a feel for the clutch and throttle I go to pause and when I put my foot down, it wasnt far out enough for me to hold the weight of the bike and I dropped it. I barely even moved away too. I apologized like it was the only thing I’m capable of saying. Offered to replace everything I damaged. I even told them if anything I’ll buy it and they dont have to worry. Buuut my husband then said after we left he wants me to commit to the 2025 r3 instead as he felt more comfortable with me on it. Told them this, and they’re probably more angry than before cause it seemed like they really just wanted me to take it after what I’d done. Thankfully we came to an agreement and I sent them $230 for parts they found on revzilla. I really wish they made some sort of response to all my apologies but idk. They come from an area where people are stereotyped to be prickly but aye. I technically do deserve it. But man they kept pushing it on me as if that was my first bike ever 😭 like yeah I know I’m young and a girl but pleeeease I promise I’m not as clueless and inexperienced as you think I am. 

Anywho, feel free to shit on me cause damn 🫠","I made an already nervous bike seller regret ever entertaining me by dropping the bike they’re tryna sell.

"TIFU that the current weed vapes work!
Before COVID, weed wasn’t legal in New York, and we used to have those Delta-8 weed pens that were supposed to get you high, but they never worked for me. I’d smoke the whole thing and barely feel anything—I never understood why.

Fast forward to last month: I meet someone for the first time, and they’re using a weed vape, gradually getting high. I was like, you’re playing me here, because I remember those things not working. To prove my point, I decided to smoke the whole thing in front of them while playing cards. I smoke cigarettes, so smoking is second nature to me.

I smoked the entire vape over the course of an hour, didn’t feel a thing… and then it hit me. It started in my legs and spread through my whole body. I got disgustingly high and super anxious, so I asked that person how many puffs it takes for them to get high. She said three. Haha. That’s when I got so paranoid.

I wasn’t prepared—hadn’t eaten or drunk anything, which made it worse. That experience made me realize I never want to smoke weed again. I got into an Uber to go home, but I couldn’t handle watching the cars disappear beside me, so I made the driver drop me off in the middle of the Williamsburg Bridge—which is crazy.

A lot happened before I could finally sleep it off.","Thought weed vapes didn’t work, smoked an entire one to prove a point, got insanely high and paranoid, made an Uber drop me off on the Williamsburg Bridge, and now I never want to smoke weed again.","Smoked a vape in front of a stranger, got super paranoid, made the driver drop me off in the middle of the Williamsburg Bridge."

Update:  I did it!!! Got my race done in less than 1 hour and 30 minutes ^_^!! Thank you all for the support I appreciate the encouragement.

As the title states I signed up for a 5 mile race. I thought it was just a silly St. Patricks day 5k, lo and behold its a 5 mile race, in 14 days. Im a home body who hasnt been on a real run in actual years. Now I have to manage to get to the point where I can at least finish the race. Thankfully based on last years last place finisher they got it done in an hour and a half, so I really just need to beat that pace. I dont want to back out on the race since I already paid the fees and paid for the merch. Back when I was running 4 miles was my typical standard, but I do have to admit I am out of shape, and I had my ACL repaired a few years ago. This will be interesting.

So I love to have my cat in my room with me when I am sleeping. The other night was no different but I woke up to her throwing up just before 3:00 a.m. so me being the mature and responsible person I am shout for my mum to come and clean it up which she does and at this point the cat has left and gone on to the landing where she will probably stay for the rest of the night. At this point it is already 3:00 a.m. and I decide that I may as well get a bit more sleep so I lie on my right side and try and get comfortable. I am interrupted by the sound of my bedroom door being smashed open and with it being 3:00 a.m. my mind immediately goes to some form of demon trying to eat me. My cat climbs onto the corner of my bed and I assume that she was just going to curl up and go to sleep and we can forget this ever happened, I was so wrong. I feel her climbing onto my left arm and shoulder and walking around the bit but I don't move or react and I am still trying to get to sleep.

This happened because I was (okay and probably still am) a dirty scumbag and peed in a bottle (and eventually a small toy trash can) in the corner of my room, because my parents would always get annoyed at me using the toilet at night(they were also annoyed at the room peeing). As one might expect from a dirty slime, I didn’t really empty it all that much, so last night on my routine piss, I accidentally dropped the trash can and it spilled everywhere, where we get to the current state of things.

"TIFU by accidentally joining a secret society and now I think I’m in too deep
This happened last night, and I’m genuinely unsure if I’m about to get recruited into some Eyes Wide Shut-type situation or if I just hallucinated everything due to sleep deprivation.

So, my friend invited me to a “networking event.” You know the type—some overpriced, dimly lit bar with men in expensive suits who call themselves “founders” but don’t actually seem to have jobs. But I’m trying to be a functioning adult, so I put on my best “I have my life together” outfit and go.

The second I walk in, something feels… off. No one is actually talking about work. Instead, they’re throwing around weird phrases like, “The third moon has risen” and “We await the signal.” I laugh, thinking it’s some inside joke. Nope. DEAD serious.

I make eye contact with my friend, who gives me a nervous smile before whispering, “Just go with it.”

Go with WHAT?

Before I can ask, a guy in a velvet cloak (yes, CLOAK) clinks his glass and announces, “It is time.”

Suddenly, everyone starts chanting some Latin-sounding nonsense, and before I know it, I’m being ushered into a back room. Someone hands me a candle. Someone else whispers, “Are you ready to see?”

At this point, I have two choices:
	1.	Admit I have no idea what’s happening and risk looking like an idiot.
	2.	Just roll with it and pray I’m not about to get sacrificed.

Like any socially anxious person, I choose option two.

We proceed through a hidden door into a room lit entirely by candles. There’s a symbol on the wall that looks suspiciously like the Starbucks logo, but evil. At this point, I’m fully convinced I’ve either been inducted into a cult or I’m about to be pranked by some YouTube dude with 6M subscribers.

Then, the cloaked guy pulls out a scroll, looks directly at me, and says:

“It is decided. You are the Keeper.”

Excuse me, the WHAT now???

Everyone starts clapping. Some old man pats me on the back and says, “A great honor.” My friend gives me a thumbs-up like this is totally normal. I, meanwhile, have NO IDEA WHAT I’VE JUST AGREED TO.

At this point, I panic and do what any rational person would do—I down my drink and bolt. Except before I can make it out the door, the cloaked guy calls out:

“The Keeper cannot run.”

So now, I’m sitting at home, Googling “how to politely quit a secret society” and waiting for my friend to text me back. I think I might be in too deep.","Went to a networking event, accidentally got inducted into a secret society, and now I might be their “Keeper.” Send help.",I accidentally joined a secret society and now I think I’m about to be pranked.
"TIFUpdate: watching people have sex
The French guy has been staying in my apartment for the past few days. I gave him a couple of days, max. However, 2 days eventually became 3 days, and the 3rd day was literally yesterday, which is when the French invasion finally came to an end. This was never part of my plan, especially after the events of my previous post, but the French guy showed up at my apartment following yet another explosive argument with his ex gf and asked me if I was willing to make him my temporary roommate for a day or two because being roommates with his ex gf was not exactly, how do you say, peaceful, no? 

The French guy had enough social awareness to at least acknowledge how inappropriate it was to expect anything from me considering the fact that A) we hardly knew each other, and B), based on our recent history, I knew enough about the rollercoaster he called a relationship to not want any part of it, but apparently all of the people he used to call friends were supposedly friends with his ex gf first, which made him feel like he had zero support and nowhere to go, so he decided to make his problem, our problem. I was reluctant to get involved, but he seemed vulnerable as fuck, and I was too weak to tell a heartbroken man to fuck off, so I made him promise me that he would be gone in 2 days. As you know, it was more than 2 days. It was 3 long days of feeling like I fucked up. Let me explain.

**Day 1:**

The French guy not only decided to cook for me towards the end of the day, but he also seemed to enjoy listening to me complain about work. It actually would have been a surprisingly wholesome first day, if the French guy didn't feel the need to joke about getting an erection from hearing me use ""big English words"" to describe my responsibilities at work. I awkwardly called it a night as soon as it became clear to me that one of us did indeed have a boner that was very fucking hard to miss.

**Day 2:** 

The French guy convinced me to join him for an early morning run. Along the way, he approached different girls on the street and thickened his already thick French accent before saying ""if I can prove I have your name on my butt chiiiik, can I please get your numbuuh?"" If the girl said yes, which most of them did, the French guy would reveal the words ""your name"" tattooed on his butt cheek. It was kind of cringe, not gonna lie, but he would get a laugh out of the girls, as well as their number. One of the girls happened to be someone I had a small crush on back in high school. She was too focused on the French guy to notice me struggling to catch my breath in the background, let alone recognise or remember me, which obliterated what little self confidence I had left by the time we were done running.

**Day 3:**

Aka yesterday. The French guy was supposed to leave, but instead of saying goodbye, he asked for an extension. An extension with an incentive. The French guy said if I allowed him to stay for just one more day, he could arrange to have sex in front of me with someone who was not his ex gf, if, of course, that was still a fantasy I wanted to explore. I said it was too soon after what happened last time, which prompted him to pull out his phone and show me borderline Only Fans photos on social media of an attractive girl who was apparently down to fuck while being watched. According to the French guy, she was like him. An exhibitionist. One of many exhibitionists the French guy said he knew.

I automatically stopped thinking with my brain after seeing what the girl looked like and instructed the French guy to pull whatever strings he had to pull to make that shit happen. The French guy confirmed that the girl confirmed that she was free to fuck from 7 o'clock the evening. Cut to 7 o'clock the evening. The French guy made dinner. I made sure the apartment was spotless. Both of us looked our best. But it was only the two of us. And it stayed the two of us long enough for me to begin wondering if the French guy really arranged to have sex with someone or if he was just willing to say anything to be my unofficial roommate for another day. 

What made me doubt his intentions even more was the fact that he was constantly feeding me. Literally. Like he would put a spoonful of whatever in my mouth every time he saw a gap. I never hated what I tasted, he's an excellent cook, but based on how day 1 ended, it was unclear if there was, you know, something a tad bit gay going on. I gradually gave up when it was almost 9 o'clock, and no girl. Whenever I asked the French guy if she was still coming, he would end up calling or messaging her before telling me that she was not responding. I decided to finish my dinner and go to bed. A few minutes after 10 o'clock, the French guy knocked on my door and informed me that the girl actually showed up.

Against my better judgement, I got out of bed without getting out of my pajamas and left my room to meet the girl. I was more in the mood sleep than to watch people have sex, but the girl was very apologetic about being late and seemed keen to get going. Her looks and enthusiasm overshadowed the long list of random reasons she had for ghosting the French guy and showing up hours late, so I was like, you know what, fuck it, let's just go. The girl took the lead when everyone agreed to proceed. She made me understand that it was very unusual for something like this to happen in such an impromptu way, but she owed the French guy a favour, so she was willing to go with the flow and skip straight to sex.

Speaking of sex, there was, yet again, no sex. During foreplay, specifically mid BJ, the French guy struggled to get it up. It happens to the best of us, so I didn't judge, but it was painful to watch, especially when it became obvious that he was not gonna get it up no matter what the poor girl did. The French guy repeatedly said ""I'm so saw-WEE"" and low key implied that his erection was not happening because he was not used to having voyeuristic sex with someone who was not his ex gf. When the girl heard ""ex girl"", she stopped sucking the French guy's uncooperative penis and said perhaps it was not the worst idea to accept defeat and call it a night. 

Both the French guy with the flaccid dick and the naked girl whose mouth was not enough looked at me for the final decision. I took my hand out of my pants and gave them a lackluster thumbs up. The girl wasted no time getting dressed. As she was putting on her clothes as fast as possible, she was praising me being kinky enough to allow random people to fuck under my roof, even though the fucking never happened, but she also encouraged me to rather go to sex positive clubs where exhibitionism and voyeurism were allowed because it would be much safer and most likely more successful than allowing horny strangers into my personal space, only for them to disappoint me, or worse, leave cum stains on my boyfriend's Xbox.

I never had a bf or owned an Xbox, so I just assumed she was referring to an unpleasant experience she had in the past. There was no space for me comment or ask questions or even react because her closing statement was that she had studying to do for an upcoming exam, so she was gonna use the time she would've spent fucking a hot French guy in front of a dude wearing pajamas as a sign that she should've just stuck to studying to begin with. Before saying goodbye, she advised the French guy to explore healthier ways to move on from his ex and reminded me about what she said about the sex club. 

The French guy left my apartment this morning. Our bro hug felt final. I'm not sure if I'm gonna see him again. I hope not. He's not a bad guy, but my life makes more sense without him in it, no offence to the French.

Tl:Dr The French guy convinced me to let him stay at my place for a few days after his ex gf / current roommate was making his life unpleasant. His presence in my apartment came with a series of unfortunate events involving unexpectedly gay moments between us, witnessing one of my high school crushes falling for the French guy's flirtation, and another attempt at watching people have sex, only for it to end with the French guy being unable to get hard.",,"I made a French guy my temporary roommate for a couple of days, and the 3rd day was the worst day of my life."
"TIFU Driving the wrong way down a one way street
So, this morning, I decided to spice up my routine by accidentally attempting a head-on collision with the entirety of oncoming traffic.

I was leaving my hotel car park, minding my own business, when I pulled out onto what I thought was a normal road. Turns out, it was a dual carriageway. And I was now going the wrong way into two lanes of very surprised drivers.

I made it about 10 metres before my brain finally caught up with reality.

Thankfully, my survival instincts kicked in.  I executed the most frantic three-point turn of my life.  To my surprise no one honked their horn at me. 

I eventually got myself turned around, rejoined traffic (the correct way), and spent the rest of the drive marinating in my own embarrassment. Lesson learned: always check your exits. And possibly never drive again.

"TIFU by scaring fellow passengers on an international flight
Compulsory this didnt happen today but a few days back.

Anyhow - barely being able to afford my first international trip I booked the cheapest airline. But not wanting to be too cheap I paid extra and got the emergency seats because their leg space was atrocious otherwise. So I am sitting in the middle seat of the right side of the plane. 

Halfway through the flight, I decide to sleep so I take off my noise cancelling headphones and put on my eye mask. Suddenly I hear this weird whooshing sound. I ignore it but it gets a little louder - and now the people around me notice it too. I try to put my hand over the emergency exit door to confirm if it’s air leaking in or something by any chance. I don’t feel any air coming in but the sound gets a little louder. So I call the steward and he’s confused “let me ask my senior,” he says and moves to the front of the plane. 

Now the sound is continuing intermittently and I am panic talking with the girl in the corner seat of the middle aisle of the aircraft. She’s kept her book down and is now staring at the staff. Somehow they start serving food and nobody comes to check the emergency exit. We are confused but since the sound went away we figure out it’s nothing and I put my eye mask on again and the girl goes back to her book. 

Almost on signal, the sound starts again. So we call the steward once more and he assures us it’s nothing and that he asked his manager, who asked the pilot, who told him it’s normal. So I ask him “then what _is_ making the sound?” And he goes “I have no idea,” and fucking walks away. “It’s all electronic, see the panel in front of the emergency exit? The pilot must’ve run a remote check from the cockpit it’ll be fine,” my travel buddy reassures me and the girl in the middle aisle. By now the passengers in the rows behind us and in the left side rows of the aircraft are also painfully aware of this. 

It’s all quiet and we are finally at peace when the sound comes back with a fucking bang. And now it’s so loud that people three rows behind us are panicking. So we press the call button for the steward who is busy serving snacks and apparently doesn’t care about us dying. 

Suddenly the girl in the middle aisle says “dude is this from your headphones?” And I am like what even noooo. And I show my travel buddy’s headphones up in the air to gesture _how can they make this weird sound_ And as I pick up my own headphones I realise they’re the ones ringing like the siren of death. Their noise cancelling was on and as soon as I switched it off the noise stopped (we checked and the battery got corroded somehow - these are eight year old Bose that have been repaired twice so you get it but this has never happened before).

Everyone around literally put their face in their hands or facepalmed and looked at me like I am the dumbest person on the planet. Then we all laughed so loud that people in business class stood up to see what’s happening. I swear to god some people would’ve opened that emergency exit and thrown me of the plane if they could. But yes - this is now a story for the world to laugh too…","my old headphones made a sound/noise that sounded like sound rushing in from the emergency exit which scared passengers on my flight about our mortality xD

"TIFU by fixing a broken oven
So, the ignition switch on our gas oven has been playing up for a while. The oven is a Beko cheapo brand gas cooker and with the ignition switch playing up, we've been having to manually light the gas rings on the hob or reaching into the oven to get it going. 

I decided, having already run out of hair to singe on my arm by manually lighting the oven, to fix the ignition switch.

I pulled off the dials and removed the front fascia to get to the internal gubbins and found the culprit which was a badly soldered connection. I resoldered it, tested it and all was working fine. 

Now, for some reason this wire, which was insulated, was quite long and there was quite a lot to feed back in when re-attaching the front fascia. I was in a rush and didn't feed everything back in but assumed it would all sit behind the metal fasteners on the fascia. Now, here where I screwed up. The front fascia is a mixture of plastic and metal and the lip which attaches to the front of the oven had quite a sharp edge. 

When pressing the fascia back into place, the metal edge hit the live ignition wire and cut through the insulation on the wire. This meant that suddenly, I was holding onto a live piece of metal. 

I was thrown back about two meters, electric burns on my hands. To add insult to injury, Our kitchen has a tiled floor so when I landed, I knocked myself unconscious.",Almost killed myself by accidentally cutting into a live wire.,TIFU by fixing a broken oven.

"TIFU by picking up random bank cards
So I (20m) was on my to the staff room to fill up my water bottle and on the way there I saw a Bank Card and a bus pass just sitting on the floor and I thought I should be a Good Samaritan by picking it up so no one else could use them (poor decision in hindsight I know that now) so I put the cards in my wallet along with all the other “dummy cards” or so I call them, basically blocked bank cards I’ve found randomly that don’t work so if my wallet gets stolen it’s a dummy that people take. It sounds bad but I’ve used this method all my life and it’s saved me a lot of hassle. But in my haste to not get in trouble for disappearing on the job, I rushed back upstairs to see a large queue and began dealing with all of it, forgetting about the cards until the assistant manager called me for a search after my break, I was the last one to get searched all day, and as I asked what I’m getting searched for, they brought up the cards and I immediately told them that yes I did have the cards, and it just slipped my mind, handing them over straight away. But obviously protocol means they had to report the security search, which also means looking at all of the other cards which aren’t mine, making me look even more suspicious than I would have been if I only had the staff workers cards. 

I then had to go upstairs to the managers office to explain myself but my manager wasn’t listening to me because it was clearly guilty until proven innocent, but with no cameras downstairs they decided to do an investigation so now I am suspended with pay pending investigation. 

The issue now arises in two extra things. 

The dummy cards happen to belong to a previous coworker that lost his cards that I never met, we worked in different departments and never interacted so I never learned of him, but with his cards in my wallet it made me look even more suspicious.

"TIFU by getting emotional and possibly ruining my ten year old daughter's relationship with her friends after no one showed up to her birthday party.
My daughter has never had a birthday party before, she has always struggled to make friends. She has really put herself out there and actually made friends with a group of girls and I'm very proud of her so when she asked for a birthday party this year, I was happy to oblige. Her birthday party was this past Saturday.

We had decorated our place with balloons and stuff. We set up the food, snacks, and cake and the party packs that we chose together. My daughter kept straightening things up trying to make sure everything looked perfect, she was very excited. The only people who showed up to the party were the elderly neighbours that my daughter and I are close to and a friend of mine and his fiancee. 

My daughter spent almost the whole day looking out the window waiting for her friends to show up and not one of them did, it was sad to witness. When the day came to an end, she cried in my arms sad that not even one of her friends came. It was very hard to witness, she even went to bed earlier than her bed time because she was so upset.

I was really sad for her and found myself messaging the parents of the girls. I  went on a rant telling them that it was really inconsiderate of them to not show up to my daughter's party when they said they would, my daughter was really looking forward to it only for her friends to not show up and she was left completely heartbroken, they could have the decency to let me know at least. I then promptly blocked them. I unblocked them the next day after calming down and apologized for being overly emotional but I think the damage had already been done.

Well thanks to my little blow up, the friends that my daughter worked so hard to make are now avoiding her and although my daughter says it's okay and that she will make new friends, I know that she is pretty heartbroken. I am now regretting and wondering if I could have had a much better approach.

"TIFU by thinking smoking and drinking would be fine for my first and second time(it wasn’t)

Sorry Reddit, this is a long one. So this story takes place about 4 and a half years ago, I was somewhat fresh out of highschool, and had picked up my first job about 6 months prior. Now I would say I was a pretty good student/person, and I wasn’t one to really do many bad things, I drank from time to time in social settings, but that was pretty much it. Never once touched weed in my life and I didn’t really have much intentions to do so and that was until october 2020.

 I was invited to a kickback with some of my coworkers at one of their houses, there was like 6 of us I believe and I remember one of them had brought gummies, a bong, and a blunt. I had already had some drinks prior and was feeling a bit buzzed, nothing crazy, when I had the bright idea I wanted to try gummies for my first time. Now nobody there told me that having gummies your first time would be a bad choice, but there I went, eating half of the 10mg gummy. (Now something to note is I told them before hand it was my first time so my tolerance was 0 and yet nobody warned me)About 20 minutes or so pass and I haven’t felt a thing, so I decide to down the other half. Another 10-15 minutes pass and I feel a bit giggly but I thought maybe that was placebo, I had more to drink and thought maybe it was that, but for some reason, my dumbass grabbed 2 more WHOLE gummies and downed them before having them taken away from me. 

At first everything was fine, I wasn’t feeling much, but then about 10 minutes later, I was on the couch talking to one of my friends, I remember them getting up and then the world just started to spin. I will admit, for the first maybe 20 minutes it wasn’t actually too bad, it felt weird because I couldn’t really control what I was doing but I went with it. After that initial start it only went downhill. The whole trip itself isn’t necessarily a blur, but kinda choppy I guess. I remember started to complain to them that I was scared and literally bawling my eyes out asking to call my parents because I needed help. They wouldn’t let me because they didn’t want to get in trouble and instead reassured me it would be okay. Another thing to note here is that I am a Christian, and the only reason I’m saying that is because for some reason, I genuinely thought I was in hell like 30 minutes in. There was a point in time that I remember I would walk into the room, (this part is stupid I don’t know why I said this but apparently I did) and I would say “I’m in sound” yea I don’t know what the fuck i was thinking(I wasn’t) but I would walk into the room with everyone in there, basically my eyes would shut and my body would collapse and I would re open my eyes and the process would start all over again, everyone was saying the same things, same motions. Over. And over. And over for what felt like hours and hours. I was genuinely convinced I was dead and was going to experience this forever. I also remember being outside screaming for help and I remember they put me down against the fence and was trying to get me to shut up by covering my mouth, but I thought they were demons and I kid you not I legit couldn’t even breathe. Yea I know the story sounds crazy over just WEED but it’s true. I also remember always being thirsty and whenever I would try to drink water it made me go through the “infinite cycle again” weird right? I also vaguely remember needing to go to the bathroom and begging my friend to go with me because I needed help😭 they told me I was a big boy and could do it myself (I ended up doing it myself like a big boy) The rest of the night was pretty choppy and I don’t remember everything that happened I just know I kept asking what time it was throughout the night like every minute. I did eventually fall asleep and when I woke up the next morning we were all able to joke about me having the worst trip they’ve ever seen and I was able to joke around about it too, it shook me up a bit but overall I ended up being fine the next day. 

Unfortunately the same cannot really be said about the second time. If you thought this one was bad the second one tops this by about a mile. 

So after the first trip, I told myself I probably would never touch weed again, granted I wanted to know what it felt like to have a good high and not be tripping I wasn’t really pursuing it. People would offer me weed a lot and I always said no, but about 2 years after the first incident I found myself in a situation where I was willing to give it another try. Big mistake. Funny enough it was around halloween time again. My best friend(let’s just call him Gabe) was in college at the time, I was just working and had gone to community college(didn’t want to be in debt lol) but he had just gotten a house with another good friend of ours(let’s call him Chris) and 2 other roommates and he had been hosting the occasional kickback at his house because it was a way for a lot of us to get together and hangout and since it was Halloween Gabe and his roommate (we’ll call him Sam) wanted to throw a little Halloween party and I was invited. Also good thing to note was I was talking to a girl at the time whom I had fallen hard for(another mistake), she was supposed to go with me to this party and ended up bailing on me like she had been doing so going into this I was pretty upset and wanted to just forget about everything happening and have a good time. 

Anyways, a few hours in, the party was going, there was maybe 30-40 people there, I really only knew my 2 friends and Sam but I’m quite social so I didn’t mind meeting new people. One of which was one of Sam’s good friend (we’ll call him Dean, lots of names I know but they’re important to know) but it was quite a small place, but everyone was having a good time, I was playing some drinking games and I wasn’t drunk but I was pretty close, and while playing these games I found myself and Dean talking a lot about common interests and it seemed as though I made a good friend. At this time Sam also announces that his plug was coming through with some blunts for anyone who was interested to share and I thought yknow what, why not? It’s been a few years since last incident, I won’t be doing gummies, so everything should be fine right? So about 8 of us including me went outside to smoke, now at this point I’m not too fucked up from the drinks but definitely have had a few and I’m feeling it… and obviously I should have gone into this without alcohol in my system but oh well. Everyone was passing around the blunt and taking hits myself included, I was trying to limit myself to how much I had knowing my previous experience, although I didn’t know what was “enough hits” per say, by this time I’ve probably had like 5 or 6 hits maybe, but the blunt was getting somewhat short and that’s when Chris hands the rest to me and tells me I should kill it. I’m pretty bad at peer pressure so when multiple people told me to do it I caved In and started to take fat fucking hits of it until it was almost dead and then I handed it back to Chris. (I’m an idiot)Everything was fine until it kicked in a few minutes later and oh boy did it kick in. As soon as I felt it I immediately got a wave of severe anxiety thinking about my first experience. 

At this point everything is already going to shit and I know it is, I stand up and I remember pacing around the house looking for Gabe to hopefully help me, I remember Dean following me as I was pacing around which was odd but I didn’t really care as I just wanted this to stop. This part of the story is a bit fuzzy as I don’t really remember much, I faintly remember just losing it to the point where Gabe actually turned off the music to the party and people were “trying” to help me, I remember calling 911 for some reason, or seeing pictures going black like I was forgetting people like the Polaroid in the back of my phone, it was just black and I couldn’t remember the faces anymore. I also remember everyone was so intoxicated that nobody was really able to help me. Back to what I can remember, I remember Gabe and a few other random people praying with me, although it was more so Gabe laughing the entire time because apparently it was just funny but they didn’t understand how far gone I was, they tried to give me food saying it would help but I rejected it thinking they were just demons trying to get to me(idk why) and at this point I also hazily remember Dean being.. weird. 

I remember him getting very close and personal with me and even though I was so absolutely blasted and ridden with anxiety I knew what he was doing was wrong but I felt so defenseless. He kept trying to inch closer to me on the couch, mind you everyone is around but so fucked up they don’t know what’s happening, I remember Dean trying to give me food which I promptly rejected and when I looked back at him I kid you not his pants were literally down, yes, completely off, he immediately put them back on but it looked like he wanted to see my reaction? I honestly don’t even know. He kept trying to get to me, wouldn’t stop following me even though I was trying to get away, but it was so hard because I could barely control my body. I tried to go to the bathroom and Dean tried to force his way into there with me and I had to force back at him(forgot to say I’m 6’2” and so I can’t just be thrown around but I was so messed up it was difficult) finally locked myself in and he kept trying to get in from what I can remember. Finally he goes away and what pisses me off is how oblivious everyone there was, not even my friends were there, and the fact I didn’t even say anything to anyone, I was just so focused on trying not to hurt myself and trying to survive the night. 

Eventually it was apparent that I was not getting any better so Chris led me upstairs to his room and basically just told me to stay in there for the time being(pretty sure they didn’t want to deal with me) so while everyone is downstairs partying I’m upstairs quite literally fighting fucking demons. I remember after Chris left I was on the bed, basically rocking back and forth like I was some schizo in an insane asylum, and honestly at this point the schizo probably would seem more sane than me. At this point just like the last trip I again thought I was dead, and the reason why is I convinced myself that what I had smoked was laced with something and it basically killed me(obv not cuz everyone used it) and couldn’t really distinguish what was real and what wasn’t. I remember seeing almost like visions in my head playing out. I saw for some reason Sam admitted that it was laced, I remember seeing everyone watching and laughing as I dropped to the floor, Gabe frantically calling 911 but it was too late(again this obv never happened but my mind was making me think it was real) I was seeing my family grow throughout the years, seeing my sister have her first kid without me there and growing up, I saw the girl I had fallen for get married and start a life, and basically just everyone living there lives without me and it was so painful seeing that and feeling like I would never see them again. I wanted so bad just to talk to them, see them. At this point I thought it couldn’t get any worse and that’s when I tried calling anyone I knew. Nobody answered, and when I called my brother in law and it went to voicemail it was him crying at my funeral. I left my brother in law a voicemail apparently saying I was sorry (I guess for dying? Idek but he still makes fun of me for that voicemail to this day 😭) And after that the laughter of the party turned into cry’s of friends and family. Because I had “died” . I remember listening to them sobbing and asking me why I did it. My parents. My friends, everyone. I was just sobbing at this point and I was a complete mess, like I said before I couldn’t tell what was real and what wasn’t, I was trying to find ways to find out if I was alive or not but I didn’t know what to do, but out of no where I just remember talking, but it wasn’t even my voice, and I couldn’t even control what it was saying but yet it was coming out of my own mouth. But it kept telling me how I could have been so much more, how I threw my life away, how I had so much more left to live for but that it’s too late. I just remember crying so much, begging God for mercy on me. I can’t recall everything I said but I know I was starting to really lose it.

 Every minute felt like an hour, I would frantically pace the room, go to the bathooom, talk to myself, I don’t know how long I was in there but It was around 1am at this point when Chris kicked me out of his room and I had to go downstairs with both Sam and Dean and I was terrified. I begged Chris to let me just stay in his room but he was so drunk he just told me not to be a little bitch basically and that I’d be fine. I went downstairs and they were both out thankfully but my mind was still racing. I remember grabbing a cross and just holding it because I was so convinced I was in hell my feet even began getting hot, and I was waiting for literal demons to get me. After a bit I remember hearing weird noises from where Dean was at, it was about 20 feet from me, like a walk in closet that had a bed in there, it was hard to see but it looked like he didn’t even have pants on… but I was so focused on everything else and was so scared I paid no attention to it and tried to ignore it. I eventually somehow made it through the night, pretty sure I slept for like 1 hour if that, and the rest was just me trying to distract myself, pretty sure I was watching Minecraft videos or something😭 But when I got up  I was still extremely paranoid, I wasn’t high anymore but I still felt awful. And I looked into the little walk in closet where Dean had slept and I just remember seeing him in there and feeling terrified. I wanted to convince myself that what happened wasn’t real, but it obviously was. I don’t know exactly what he even did, because that day was such a blur for me, I’m pretty positive I was okay because I feel like I’d remember if he actually did something to me but idk. But even after that all happened I called my parents and I admitted what I did and they drove an hour to come get me, I was so paranoid I had to urgent care and get medication and I didn’t sleep for about 4 days. Still to this day, over 2 years later I still get anxiety attacks about it, they’ve become super rare, maybe a few times a year, but I’ve been able to heal as much as I’ve been able to because of the people close to me, especially my soon to be fiancé!!(not the same girl in the story lol) anyways yea this was a long one, and no this shit isn’t some made up story it was very real😭 also NO I have not touched weed since! Never again😭","had gummies after drinking for my first experience with weed and it was awful, tried smoking the second time and it was even worse😭","Took 10mg gummies for my first time, didn’t feel a thing, went to a kickback, ate half of the gummy, got taken away from me."
"TIFU Feeling of guilt of making out with a tipsy girl while relatively sober
Prior to the makeout, I just sipped some coors light and feeling just outgoing. As i continue to talk to this girl, I ask her if she wants to makeout to which she agrees and im assuming everything is ok. After, we continue talking and she tells me that she had about 2 shots and that she is a lightweight (her answer to why i asked why she so flirty). In my mind, not once did I think I was taking advantage of her since she was not slurring her words nor stumbling - just outgoing. I offer to buy her a shot for her and myself, and we just made out a couple times after that (where i was initiated most of it). After I left the club, she dmed me saying ""thank you for taking care of me"" referring to an incident of of me protecting her from a weirdo at the club trying to get touchy, but i couldnt take my mind off our makeout. The guilt ate at me so i dmed her a few weeks later a lengthy paragraph asking if she felt violated and that i was relatively sober in the encounter. She said she will get back to me and needed some time to process and blocked me right after. Idk if im overthinking, but since i was the one intiating does that make me the piece of shit, although i wasnt intentionally trying to advantage. After seeing the block, I felt so shitty and in my head, i honestly did not intend to pry on her drunken state and idk if this is considered sa. I really need some advice and feel so terrible. I've asked some of my friends for advice, but they said that im ok, but idk how to feel.","felt like a took advantage of a girl at the bar while i was relatively sober and she had two shots but i assumed she was consenting

TIFU I introduced my boyfriend to Minecraft - 1+ year update,"- I'm single. I have a fear of dating. Ex 1 is still in love with me, and ex 2 is into aubergines

Previous post https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/s/RJvc8eUTeF

In a few months it will be 2 years since I made the post so I thought I would give an update incase anyone was curious. 

Minecraft guy moved in not long after I made the post. Things continued to be rocky in the bedroom, and he had 'reasons' for everything, for example: We're late to his mum's, it's cause of traffic (he took too long figuring out what to wear). There's dirt under his desk, it's cause a breeze from the closed back door blew it there (his feet). He woke up at 1pm on his day off, it's because his work has granite floors that gave him achy calves (he went to bed at 3am). He gives these reasons unprompted. At first I found them annoying, but now I find them amusing. 

Putting those aside, he's a really nice guy. I told myself sex isn't everything, he's funny, helps out, gets me meds when I'm sick, and with him contributing to the rent, it means I can pay off my debt faster. 

Then I got him the game he wanted for his birthday, BG3. He LOVES it. If he's not at work, he's at home playing it, or watching YouTube videos on it, or surfing the BG3 sub Reddit.... And that was the final nail in the coffin. No matter how often I advised him to set an alarm so he could come to bed early and spend a bit of time with me, he always came to bed past midnight. 

I'm really happy for him and his game relationship, but he isn't taking the break up well. He knows there's no going back. I made it VERY clear. None the less, he's afraid to hook up with anyone in case I refuse to get back with him once I'm ready to start dating... He's turned down 2 women already, and a third has hinted her interest, but he continues to ignore it. 

If you're wondering why I haven't asked him to move out: economy, and he really is a good housemate. 


As for my ex partner. A few of you were concerned and felt they needed to see a specialist. I thought it was possibly depression brought on by COVID, or maybe I wasn't throwing enough bread or carrots at them (I might have succeeded with a villager outfit). We were wrong. They came out at the beginning of last year as trans. Honestly, I'm happy for her. She was always quiet and not social, and other than with me, she was distant with everyone. She's like a different person now. She has friends, she goes out. The best way I can describe it is she's alive. She's actually living rather than existing. Her libido came back! And... she's into men 😬 


I.. need a therapist, or to buy a new dildo, give it a name and marry it. At the moment I'm honestly afraid of dating. I've had 4 relationships: melt down guy (I couldn't voice any unhappiness or concerns, or he'll have a meltdown), in denial girl (I told her many times she might be into aubergines), BG3 guy (he's eventually going to move on right?.. Right?), and ... I'm ashamed of this one, my 1.5yr relationship with the guy who was **REALLY** into short girls (below 5ft) with tiny bodies (I'm neither). 

I've started working on myself, to understand why I get into these kinds of relationships, and why I then work to keep the relationship alive, when I should have let it die sooner. 

And while I believe I should remain single while I work on myself, the same question keeps replaying in my mind; Some of you said I'm an AH for getting into a relationship with someone I'm sexually incompatible with (paraphrasing) but how are you supposed to know?!!!! BG3 guy I specifically asked about his libido when we started dating and he told me it was high. Like, how are you supposed to know it's not till the honeymoon phase is over?!


Thank you for the funny comments, and thank you to all who showed concern and gave genuine advice.

To the guy who messaged me asking for advice on how to get his girlfriend to open their relationship. You can't. 

The rest of the DMs were ignored.",Minecraft
"TIFU by falling down the stairs seeing the face of a newly disfigured coworker
All we knew before today was that our work colleague Su went through a house fire and was hospitalised. No one in the office were too close with Su so we didn't know the extent of her injuries, only that it took her several months to recover.

Today morning, I was entering the office when I saw my boss entering at the same time so I ran up to him and started chatting about our project. 

I admit, I was pretty focused on discussing, and I was doing the thing where me and my boss was walking side by side and clogging the whole path. Whilst walking up the stairs, I hear a soft ""cuse me"" (I later learnt she also lost most of her speech functionality too).

You can see where the FU happens. I realise that I was blocking her way, so I quickly apologised and shifted to the side, but when I naturally looked behind me, she was literally one step away from me walking onto my step, so her face was about 20cm from mine.

It's really hard to put it into words, but imagine a face as a piece of paper, her face is the paper crunched up and reopened and then shoved into one side, and colored bright red.

I was completely taken by surprise as are my boss. I let out quite a loud ""AHH!"" And felt my foot slip. I lost my balance and slid down half a flight of stairs, and slammed my back into the wall.

The angle was pretty lucky to not be significant, but I was still wheezing and gasping for quite a while. During which most of our coworkers heard my scream, came out, saw Su, my boss, and me on the ground.

My boss being the kind man that he is, insisted on taking me to the hospital for a checkup. I was feeling pretty bad at the moment so I agreed, and he drove me to the hospital.

I returned in the afternoon after being cleared by the doctor, and I wanted to apologise to Su since I didn't get the chance to when I left in the morning. But when I asked around, HR said that after I left, she (they think) starting crying and left as well, and soon after sent an email wanting to resign immediately.

I sent her an email somewhere along the lines of. ""Hey Su, glad you are well enough to be back in the office now. Sorry I didn't get a chance this morning to apologise, I was just a bit surprised, hope you can reconsider leaving us.""","I saw a close up of my coworker's horribly disfigured face, and fell down half a flight of stairs as a result",TIFU by falling down a flight of stairs seeing the face of a newly disfigured coworker.
"TIFU by accidentally lacing myself with chloroform
So this happened a while ago, but I figured it was finally time to share. I smoke weed occasionally. Im not a huge drug user, just weed and I’ve done mushrooms a couple times. I used to smoke daily in the summer, but when school started and it got colder, I didn’t want to go outside cause it was cold and scary. But every time I smoked in the house I got caught no matter what I did, so one night I got creative.

I grabbed say 10 dryer sheets, a towel, and my bong, then locked myself in our tiny let’s say 5x5 windowless bathroom in the basement. I lined the towel with dryer sheets, rolled it up and got to work. I have a super low tolerance for drugs, and hate feeling out of control, back then I could smoke 2-3 bowls and I was good, nowadays one hits me hard. That night, I took my first hit, shoved the towel in my face and breathed in it for a while.  After a while I remembered thinking “holy shit, this is strong,” but I took another bowl anyway.

I was down there for about an hour, on and off the phone with some friends, just chilling. When I went for my second toke, i smoked about half before suddenly feeling insanely sick. I shoved everything in the corner, ran upstairs, and had the worst trip of my life. My mind was racing, I was hallucinating (which is crazy because I have aphantasia and can’t visualize things). At one point, I saw a tiny rollercoaster of mice all holding cheese flying past my face. I was genuinely tweaking the fuck out, I remember being huddled over my trash can mumbling, “it’s only a bad trip if you say it’s a bad trip,” trying to keep myself together.

This went on for three hours, which made no sense for just a toke and a half. I eventually woke my mom up because I legit thought I was dying. She gave me water and crackers, and within 10 minutes, I was fine.

The next morning, I did some research because what the actual fuck was that? The weed was from a dispensary, and I’d smoked it before with no issues. Turns out, dryer sheets have some crazy chemicals like benzyl acetate, camphor, and chloroform. I don’t know which one did it, but I basically gassed myself trying to cover the smell of weed.

That was the last time I ever smoked it my house and to this day, the towel, my bong and the half smoked toke is still in the corner of the bathroom.",my ass didn’t want to go outside to smoke so bad that I straight up started huffing dryer sheets. Fuck my life.,I accidentally laced myself with chloroform and thought I was dying.
"TIFU by spitting in my girlfriend's face
So I (M26) and my girlfriend (F30) were engaging in our natural obligations. I was on top and talking dirty to her. Whilst talking dirty she shouted ""You spit in my face"". Apparently, I was spraying it, not saying it. I have gapped teeth, it happens.

However, this is not what I heard. What I heard was ""Spit in my face"", as in, a command, not a ""Please don't spit when you talk""

So I obliged her instantly. Just Hawk Tuah'd right on her face. At first she was laughing hysterically, but then she got angry and refuses to see how exactly this might have been an accident on both our parts.

Anyway she's mad now, and I am sleeping on the couch tonight. I think this is funny, and to be honest, it's worth the anger. Hopefully she will understand later.",Misunderstood criticism as instruction. Spat in my girlfriend's face.,I spit in my girlfriend's face.
"TIFU by letting my friend drink my mom's coke
So, about ten years ago, my mom died unexpectedly. I'm not sure if this was a thing everywhere, but at that time in the US, Coke Cola was running this 'Share a Coke' ad campaign. Basically, they printed a bunch of labels on their bottles that said 'Share a Coke with \*Person's Name\*'. People got really into finding a bottle with their name on it. Anyway, the day after she passed, I happened to come across a bottle with my mom's name on it. Her name isn't that common, so I took as one of those 'she'll always be with you'  kind of moments. I bought the bottle and stuck it in my fridge because....idk that's where you put Coke? I don't like Coke so there wasn't any risk of me accidentally drinking it. 

Fast forward to last weekend, that Coke bottle has known been my fridge for over ten years (well, three different fridge since it's survived two moves). I had an old college friend who was coming to visit me for a couple of days. Since his flight got delayed, I ran to the store to pick up some stuff for him. He likes Coke, so one of the things I grab is a six pack of Coke which I stick in the fridge. 

Since I'm not consciously thinking about my Mom's weird memorial death coke on a daily basis, I don't mention to him when I tell him 'there's Coke in the fridge'. Ten minutes later, we're talking in the living room together as he drinks his Coke. While we're talking, I happen to notice my mom's name on the side of the bottle and gasp. Then, out of shock, I start laughing hysterically. It takes me a solid five minutes to explain to him what happened through my laughter. My friend comes to the slow realization of why his Coke tasted so flat and is understandably horrified. 

Feeling guilty, I suggest he finish the Coke and I could just keep the empty bottle. He was even more horrified by this idea, so we eventually decide to just dump the rest of the Coke down the drain. I'm still keeping empty bottle and my friend is now laughing with me about the whole thing. I get the sense that he'll probably get a hotel if he's in town again though.",I accidentally forgot this weird memorial coke I got to honor my mother was in the fridge and my friend accidentally drank it.,I accidentally drank my mom's coke after she died.
"TIFU by getting so lucky that I wasn’t asked back to a gig
Obligatory “not today but” last year, I answered an ad to help out with the local high school’s theater production. The actual job that I was hired to do I did well, but this isn’t about that. The production ran from Thursday to Sunday, one show each night. At intermission, there was a 50/50 lottery, with the other half going to senior scholarships.

On Thursday night, at intermission, I bought 10 tickets for $5. I won! Pretty sweet feeling, was about $100 richer.

On Friday night, I decide, “What the hell, why not try again?”, and I do the same thing: 10 tickets for $5. Wouldn’t you know it, I won again! High off the buzz of my second win and being a charitable guy, I suggested they donate it all. This earned me some applause.

By Saturday night, the general public had heard what was going on. At intermission, there was a definite murmur in the crowd. My fiancée and my sister came, and we all did my usual buy, but none of us won. People seemed relieved by this.

On Sunday night, I thought, “You know, wouldn’t it be the funniest thing if I won again?” So, same routine. 10 tickets for $5. Same mood in the crowd, people were looking at me and all that. I won. Again. People groaned. Now I had a choice to make. I decided that I had the feeling of winning, and I had been charitable, but maybe it would be nice to give someone else the feeling of winning, so I suggested that they call another number. Well, I had bought 10 tickets. So, they called another one of my numbers. People went NUTS. Someone shouted, “Oh, come on!” The director suggested I donate the money again, but I took the cash, because I figured some spiritual force with a good sense of humor really wanted me to have it. People were not happy about this. When I walked out at the end, some lady booed me.

It’s about the same time this year, and I haven’t been asked back. I’m sure there are several benign explanations as to why, but I’d like to think it’s because they’re afraid I have some lottery black magic. I’ve never won anything since.","; won a lottery 4 out of 5 times at a gig, and that may be why I wasn’t asked back",Got so lucky that I wasn’t asked back to a gig last year.

"TIFU by sending nude and accidentaly face pic to stranger.
Years ago I was listening to erotic hypnosis. I made tiktok account with name of those files. I stopped listening to it because I figured that it is not for me. I forgot about that tiktok account. Month ago I remembered that I have that account and I logged in. I had circa 1000 followers. Most if them were Mistresses that asked me for money. I rejected them all. But one if them didn't want money. She told me her lication and kinks, I told her my location and kinks. Then she asked me for zangi.

I decided to send it. Zangi for some reason selected that picture, face is not visible on it and second picture where I have clothes but face is visible. I deleted it fast, but she received it.

TIFU by urinating where I shouldn't,"I pissed in a garbage in my floor because I couldn't open the door
so, it's carnival in Brazil and I was out drinking with friends. When I got to the building where I live, I started to feel like passing myself but I couldn't get the door open because my my key was stuck. I couldn't hold it any longer and went to the garbage the staff keeps in each floor on the stairs. The thing is, I have no ideia if they have cameras in there (I looked around, but didn't find any, which means nothing) so now I'm afraid they will know it was me and even more afraid of they leaking the footage or something. I know for sure they have caneta on the elevators, but now I'm getting paranoid about the possibility of people knowing it was me. Of course I'm sorry, but I would definitely do it again because I couldn't hold any longer and I started pissing even before I could lower my shorts, so now I have dirty shorts and undies, probably got some on the shirt as well",I'm an idiot
"TIFU by pressing the wrong button
I was in school, as usual. I had a careers meeting which is where you have the opportunity to speak to a careers adviser. I was heading out of the maths block, when the door was locked!

Oh dear... I look and yay! There's a button to unlock the door, so I press it. And a blaring alarm goes off... It was the wrong button. I checked and it said ""emergency door locked"" or something like that. And right next to it, was the one I should have pressed.

It scared the hell out of me, I thought everyone might start piling out. Teachers did, thankfully no students. I was apologetic and they let me go with no consequences (I am a reasonably good student.)

Apparently in my sister's class who happened to be in the block, some kid said it was a carbon monoxide alarm and so everyone was holding their breaths. In my class everyone assumed it was a radon alarm since we have high levels of radon gas in some classes of my school (some have been closed.)

"TIFU by accidentally getting high.
You guys are going to think I'm stupid but I didn't know you weren't supposed to do this. 

Today I went to victorias secret and bought a perfume. On the way back from the mall I was hoping my crush would sit next to me on the bus on the way back. (lots of irrelevant context here, but apparently this post has to be 750 characters long and idk what other subreddit to put this in) Anyway I go to the bathroom in the mall and I thought to myself exactly this: ""mouthwash has alcohol in it. That's what kills germs that cause bad breath. Perfume has alcohol in it. That should work"" and I sprayed inside of my mouth like twice, and spit it back out. It tasted gross. Crush didn't sit next to me. Not sure the effect it had on my breath.

Anyway, fast forward an hour and I'm telling you I was seriously blasted. For context I attend a kind of boarding school. Getting high and stuff is very forbidden. But I was honestly so blasted for so long, it was really something. Not to mention nauseous. It has become apparent to me that spraying perfume in your mouth is something people are seriously not supposed to do. Lol. Apparently I'm the only one this is news to, because everyone I told has responded by telling me it's something everyone knows you obviously shouldn't do. I did not know it was that serious.

It seems dangerous to me that something so commonly bought could have such a detrimental effect on people by being misused in such a simple way as spraying it into one's mouth. Then again I've heard that if you drink visine eye drops you'll just die. And those are eye drops. That's all. Don't injest perfume guys.",I sprayed perfume in my mouth because I'm an idiot and didn't know that it can get you actually high.,I sprayed perfume in my mouth and it tasted gross.

"TIFU I feel like I've fucked up my friendship and it's messing with my mental health
This has been posted in multiple subs. This has honestly been messing with my mental health and peace. On one hand I feel that I haven't done anything wrong but at the same time I feel like I've fucked up everything.

Also just for reference I'm based in AU and I'm in a long distance friendship (time difference is two hours) and she's in a LDR with her female partner. I work two part time jobs alongside studying and she works a full time job alongside her studies. We are both diaspora Indians basically like Indo-Trini or Indo-Guyanese. My bestie is in a lesbian relationship. 

I’m a 22-year-old male studying computer science and psychology, and I’ve been best friends with N (25, studying teaching) for nearly 3.5 years. Over the past three years, I’ve financially supported N and her partner, P, in various ways. We’ve never said anything rude to each other, but recently, things have felt off. We used to talk every day, but she’s become distant, and now I barely hear from her. If I text, she either ignores it or leaves me on ""seen"" for days. Alot of times she has shared personal things with me which apparently she hasn't shared with her partner at all even when she'd be feeling hurt by something or someone. The few times we’ve talked recently, she’s mentioned feeling exhausted due to the situation with P and the financial stress she’s under, but it still feels like she’s pulling away from me.

I’ve tried apologizing for anything I might have done unintentionally, but she hasn't really responded to that—she just viewed the message after I unsent it. Despite this, we had a brief chat about helping her with some financial support for P, and she was polite but still distant. I’m starting to wonder if I’ve done something wrong, but I don’t think I have.

All I really want is to understand where she’s at, and to be communicated with about what she wants from our friendship. I just want to be able to better understand her needs and the space she might need right now. The one thing I’m hoping for is for her to say, ""Hey, everything is ok between us and we are still besties, but it's just things haven't been going well for me.""

I’m stuck between giving her space and confronting her about it. But at the same time, I don't want to keep feeling ignored. She still pops up in my message list, and I’m constantly overthinking whether she still cares about me or if she’s mentally detached herself from the friendship.

Also yes I do have other friends and I value them and cherish them ALOT especially the ones that are at my uni and workplace. I always try to be available for everyone as I do understand that people go through different things in life.

I really want to give her the space she needs, but I also want her to reach out and make some effort, especially since she’s been so supportive in the past. Does anyone else have experience with something like this? Should I continue waiting for her to reach out or confront her to get some clarity?",I honestly don't know how I fucked up but it feels like I may have unintentionally hurt her somewhere along the line and she never expressed it to me.,"My bestie is in a lesbian relationship and I’m in a long distance friendship with her.

"TIFU by making a “clever” comment and possibly getting myself unemployed
Wrong time, wrong audience, wrong everything with this one.

Situation essentially boiled down to someone on our development team violating company policies by sending out client data out of the company for their test cases. In short, not my problem…until I made it.

There i was at an hour long meeting listening to the usual shmuck saying a whole lotta nothing about how things need to change knowing fully well nothing will. Anyways in the meeting he’s trying to highlight how it looks on our group on a higher level and it doesn’t look good.

So he starts his sentence with “I’ll be frank…” and I reflexively respond “and I’ll be Patrick!” thinking my mic was muted.

The way my soul left my body when I saw the little purple flicker on my profile icon showing that my sound went through. Quiet filled the room…then he kept going “Uhh…yeah the senior leadership team has us in hot water bec-“

After the meeting ended I got a calendar notification showing that my one on one with him on Friday got moved to an hour from now…

"TIFU by trying to restore some old basketball shoes

My son's getting into basket ball and is wanting some new shoes,  I also like to play with him. Out of curiosity I went through my closet to see what kind of old shoes I still had sitting in there. 

Found a pair of And1's from like 15 years ago that seemed to be in good condition still, other than than being really stiff and a solid sole. 

I took the laces out and bleached them, also tooth brush and some cleaner to the rest of the shoe but the the sole was still so hard. I was ready to try them out anyways. 

So I basically had to beg him to come outside to play the day of the incident(2 days ago). First step out of the door onto my composite, 5 step stairs, with a railing opposite of the door opening, my foot went straight up in the air causing me to get airborne. Came down on my thigh hitting the edge of the top step as I flipped over onto the ground. 

Swelling was immediate the size of a really big potatoe, accompanied by a massive bruise spanning from my hip to my knee and almost about 3/4 of the way around my thigh. 

Got it checked out and it's a hematoma with a possible fracture to my femure. Waiting on x-rays to be read by a radiologist. Pray for me

"TIFU by being too nice to my fwb
Been seeing this girl, since January and from the get go I told her I didn't want a relationship. She agreed and suggested we become FWBs. 

It was my first time getting into a set up like this but I gave it a go. Turns out it was pretty much what I needed at this time. All the perks of a relationship minus the emotional attachment. 

It helped that this girl was good looking and we even vibed as friends. We would legit meet up sometimes and not even have sex just watch movies and listen to music. 

One thing about me is I like to surprise my friends and treat them to lunch/dinner sometimes without planning. 

Last night we met up for the deed but before that I took her to this nice place and surprised her by paying for everything. It's something I do for my guy friends and they do the same thing too. 

This morning I woke up and I was blocked everywhere. She left a message telling me she was starting to develop feelings. She knew my boundaries and couldn't help it so might as well cut things off to ""guard her heart"".

I'm a little bummed cuz she didn't even let me say my side of things. How I would totally be down for a relationship with her in the long run now. 

Thing is we have no mutual friends. I know where she lives but that would be too creepy IMO","Treated my fwb to a fancy dinner. She developed feeelings, now I'm blocked everywhere. 

Update: Wow this gained more attention than expected! Just to clarify, she lives in a condo with tight security so I can't exactly just show up at her door. 

Many have suggested writing her a letter and I feel like that is what I might do next. It's a bit too romantic for my tastes and I like being nonchalant but I think I just like this girl that much. I understand things like this can be tricky and I am admittedly at fault to as I guess I also developed feelings without being honest about it. 

I'm hesitant to get in a relationship too early as I just broke up with ny year long gf last December and recent events made me realize I still needed time to completely move on. This fact my fwb knew well. 

A silver lining thoguh is despite me being blocked everywhere else still, it seems she's unblocked me on Instagram where we used to talk a lot. I'm not sure what that mrans but I haven't messaged her there yet to give us both time to process our feelings.

"TIFU by Using a Water Bottle From High School
So I went to the gym for the first time ever yesterday. I was really anxious and self conscious the whole time. I realized halfway through that the girl on the treadmill next to me had a water bottle and I was like “Oh that’s probably a good idea.” 

Today I got ready, I decided to grab a water bottle, I have two, both from high school because since my job back then I haven’t really needed a water bottle (I’m in my second year of college). I grabbed one, inspected it to make sure it was safe to use by looking in the thing and checking the bottom of the lid. It looked fine and so I filled it and left. 

My water bottle has a lid with a latch, basically you twist this little screw and flip the latch open. It’s one of the Takeya brand ones. (This is important)

I was on the treadmill, walking, listening to music and I go to open my water bottle. There was a small smell when I opened it but I figured it was whatever. I open it again five minutes later, the smell is stronger. I open it a third time, take a sip, finally look down and there’s mold coating the top. under the latch and all over where you’re supposed to put your mouth. 

I almost fell off the treadmill I was so disgusted. I have a HUGE phobia of food poisoning and mold in general and I’m wanting to throw up just thinking back on it now. I made it through the rest of my workout without issue, went back to my apartment, tried to scrub it off and put it in the dishwasher. I think I’m just gonna have to throw the whole thing out. Even if I can get the mold out of the water bottle I’ll never be able to get it out of my head.

Now I’m just eating cereal, wondering why I didn’t notice sooner, and mourning the loss of my water bottle.","Today I fucked up by using a water bottle at the gym, not knowing it had mold in it and now I’m dying inside as my insides are dying.","Went to gym for the first time, grabbed a water bottle from high school, opened it twice, found mold coating the top, almost fell off the treadmill."
"TIFU and I might have ruin my relationship with my family
I may have just ruined my relationships with my long-lost sister, and the rest of my family.

I'm not sure if I'm here to vent or if I need advice, but I (31F) feel like I may have just ruined my relationships with my long-lost sister, and the rest of my family. 

My parents were college sweethearts, but when they were 25, my father had a quarter-life crisis and cheated on my mom with a coworker. That affair resulted in my older sister, Ashley. My father, who comes from a wealthy background with a trust fund, paid the other woman off and kept it a secret from my mother. My parents divorced when I was 8, and I didn’t know any of this until I found out about Ashley years later. My mother struggled with infertility after having me and was in the process of setting up finances for IVF when she discovered that my father had been secretly sending money to another woman. My mom wanted to do more to help Ashley, but my father wanted nothing to do with her. Finding this out completely changed my perception of my dad. I was a daddy’s girl growing up—he was my favorite parent, and I was the apple of his eye. Learning that he wasn’t the man I thought he was was devastating.  

Years later, in a strange twist of fate, Ashley’s husband, John, ended up working at my father’s law firm. Neither of them knew about the connection until they ran into each other at a company fundraiser. They initially kept their distance, but after my dad had a health scare, he reached out to Ashley, wanting to make amends. That’s when my parents finally told me about her. Ashley was very standoffish at first, and I don’t blame her. Over the past few years, we’ve been working on building a relationship—not as sisters, but as friends. Ashley and my father are cordial at best, but she does allow him to be a grandfather to her kids. The surprising part? Ashley has become incredibly close to my mom. Her kids call my mom grandma, and they meet up at least once a week. Ashley’s own mother is no longer in her life. I don’t know all the details, but from what I understand, Ashley had a rough childhood because her mom constantly put men before her. My mom, being the amazing person she is, stepped in and filled that role.  

I recently started working at my father’s law firm as an accountant. It hasn’t been easy making friends since I’m the boss’s daughter. The only person who has been genuinely kind to me is John, Ashley’s husband. He has been inviting me to lunches and after-work drinks with a group of coworkers. It was never just the two of us—there were always others there. Recently, I found out that there were lunches and hangouts I wasn’t invited to. When I asked John about it, he explained that word had gotten back to Ashley that he was spending time with a ""younger woman at work."" No one at the office knows about our family connection. Ashley confronted him, and after he explained the situation, she admitted it made her uncomfortable. John apologized to me but said he needed to put his family first.  

I did not handle this well. The last few months have been hell for me. I broke up with my long-term boyfriend, and because he worked at my old job, he made my life miserable until I finally had to quit. I didn’t want to work for my dad, but at the time, it was the only job offer I had. I finally felt like I was finding my place in the office, only to realize that at least one—maybe more—coworkers thought I was some kind of homewrecker. That night, I got absolutely wasted. In my drunken spiral, I called Ashley. I don’t remember everything I said, but I do remember telling her I wasn’t a homewrecker like her mom. Yeah. I fucked up.  

The next morning, my dad called me. Ashley had cut him off completely—again. She wanted nothing to do with him. When I told my dad what had happened, his response was that Ashley and John were right to distance themselves from me, even if what they believed wasn’t true. He said it’s about optics. That was the last straw for me—I lost it on him. He had the audacity to talk about optics when he was the one who had a literal affair. I then called my mom, only to find out that Ashley had cut her off too. My mom is devastated, and I feel like I have no one in my corner. I know I need to apologize to Ashley—I know I crossed a line. But right now, I just feel completely alone. Where do I even go from here?

**","**: My dad had an affair that resulted in my older sister, Ashley, whom I only found out about years later. Over time, we built a friendship, and she became very close to my mom. I recently started working at my dad’s law firm, where Ashley’s husband, John, also works. John was kind to me at work, but when rumors spread that he was spending time with a younger woman, Ashley got uncomfortable, and John distanced himself. Feeling isolated and frustrated, I got drunk and called Ashley, making a terrible comment about her mother being a homewrecker. Now, Ashley has cut off my dad and mom, and I feel like I’ve destroyed everything.

"TIFU by not putting on a condom, leading to ER Visit.
My(34M) girlfriend(27F) and I have been in the exploratory stage of our relationship for the past couple of months. As we are, our focus discovering more about each other beyond what we knew already from the time before we started dating. A lot of this is sexual since I've known her for a few years now. 

One of the Kinks I discovered she has is self pleasure edging instructions. To help her along, for the last couple of weeks I've been sending her ""JOI"" voice messages/videos that are anywhere from 15-30 minutes long either via FB messenger or Marco Polo. This has been a tremendous success, and has helped us both take get a better read on the other, E.G. how she responds to praise, humiliation, etc.

That brings us to this weekend. She bought me a clone-a-willie kit to enhance the future ""JOI"" that have insertion in them. 

We decided to put it to use. Following the instructions for the most part, but I forgot to put the condom on. When I removed ""myself"" from the mold, everything seemed fine. A few hours later when I went to urinate, it was all red and burned when I urinated. We immediately went to the ER.

"TIFU by destroying the 1999 holo charizard and making it into a card wallet
So this isn't really a tifu but more of a ""15 years ago i fucked up."" I (25F) love pokemon. I have loved pokemon for as long as I can remember. My older cousins were big gameing fans back in the day and they got me into many popular titles like pokemon, yugioh, animal crossing, kingdom hearts, mario kart, etc. so I started playing those games at a very early age. My first gaming console was the gameboy color (the atomic purple version 😌) and on that I played pokemon yellow and other random games at a very young age. I probably didn't even know what I was doing at the time.  But from then on I've played every single pokemon game gamefreak has released. Safe to say I'm a huge pokemon fan. 

As a kid, my parents would always buy packs of pokemon cards whenever we went to the store and I have a lot of old pokemon cards stored away in a binder. I knew nothing about the tcg ( and honestly still don't ) or what any of the cards were worth. But one day when my cousin was babysitting me, she taught me how to make a paper wallet out of trading cards, and guess what evolution line was my favorite at the time... so I crafted up a little charmander, charmeleon, charizard card wallet and used it for my huge amounts of money... It was only until a couple of years ago that I found out that that specific holo charizard was super insanely rare and worth a lot of money?? I told myself that it wasn't the same charizard and compared it to some being sold online but lo and behold it was the same one I used when I was like 8 crafting my little heart out. I attempted to save it with little damage but... he's seen better days. I have attached picture proof 🥲. Yeah so that's great. 

Anyways, in honor of pokemon day yesterday, I decided to try and find all my pokemon games throughout the years and I've found all of them except my copy of pokemon platinum and my copy of soulsilver... arguably the two most expensive games to find authentic copies of 😅. Not only that, but my copy of heartgold was the release that had the pokewalker and now, I can't find that either.

"TIFU by betting on one more hand of blackjack.
This did, in fact, happen today. 

I was at the casino, playing blackjack and losing, as one does. There was another woman next to me, who was losing a lot more money a lot faster, because she kept putting huge money on the side bets and almost nothing paid out. We were joking about hanging hard, ride or die together, etc. 

Eventually, I'm mostly cleaned out. I have $14 left, and the table minimum is $15, so I guess I can't bet. But the helpful dealer says ""you can bet with that, we won't tell anyone."" So I do, and I immediately lose. Oh well, there goes his tip.

I hang around for a few more hands to watch how the woman does, and she keeps losing up to $100 per hand. Just as I'm about to leave, though, she starts getting upset. She starts telling off the dealer because he let me bet with $14, which completely ruined the shoe and led to her losing hundreds and hundreds of dollars. This bet should have never been allowed, and so they need to ??? and get her money back. She never explains what they are supposed to do, just that they need to fix it.

She demands that the dealer pull up the cameras. She calls over two pit bosses. I try to leave, but she tells me to stay and support her, and I'm too awkward to say no so I just stand there awkwardly as she's raising her voice at everyone around her. At one point she looks at me and says ""why aren't you saying anything?!"" as if I have any understanding of what the casino is supposed to do.

Eventually I have my fill of listening to a probably drunken asshole, and I discreetly ask one of the pit bosses if I can just leave. The pit boss apologizes and I take off, with no plans to gamble again anytime soon.","I made a bet just barely under the table minimum because of a gracious dealer, and the other player at the table got absolutely pissed because I apparently ruined the deck for her.","I bet on one more hand of blackjack at the casino, and the dealer let me bet with $14, which ruined the shoe and led to her losing hundreds of dollars."

"TIFU by bird feeding water to the girl I was sleeping with
Obligatory was a few weeks ago… so me and this girl I’d known for a few months were drunk and went home together, we had never done anything sexual together but this time around we ended up in the same bed and talked for a while before eventually making out and then I gave her head. 
Afterward I was still kinda in the mood and when she asked for water I remembered seeing somewhere (ok I’ll admit it, it was on chainsaw man 😔) a chick drinking something (alcoholic now that I think about it) and then transferring that liquid from her mouth to the dude in a make out kind of way… I thought it would be pretty hot to do that IRL with the water she had just asked for so i went ahead and did it. Soooo… yeah I was wrong. 
I did it and she swallowed it and all but then was like “dude that’s fucking gross” and was genuinely disgusted I think… so yeah she then got a drink from the water bottle that I then gave her and she got up put some clothes on and went to the bathroom while I sat there and contemplated my decision. When she came back she said “you should probably go home… I have work at 8”
The next day I got a text saying “that shouldn’t have happened” (in reference to everything that went down…). So I think my water transfer method didn’t rly do it for her.

"TIFU making kohakutou candy
Throwaway acct bc dont want friends seeing lol, This fuck up started early this week and is still going.

This week i wanted to make that viral crystal candy called Kohakutou, made from water, agar agar, sugar, flavoring, and food coloring. It turned out great and as i was cutting it into shape tuesday i ate a bit of it, thinking nothing of it. Wednesday morning rolls around and im hit with horrible stomach pain and diarrhea, lasts 4-6 hours on and off. Figured something i ate caused it, whatever.

Last night the candy finally got hardened so its very satisfyingly crunchy on outside and gummy on the inside. I grabbed a handful, maybe 10 small pieces. They were delightful!

Today, however, was not delightful. Ive been having horrible stomach pain again and been running to the bathroom to have horrible diarrhea with cramp that make me almost faint, every half hour! I started looking it up and agar agar can be used as a laxative, and paired with the amount of sugar, and the fact i have ibs means this has just been so much worse. Dont be like me, make sure to only eat a few pieces at a time lest the toilet be your best friend for the next day.","made really cool looking candy, but didnt realize it was basically a laxative.","Made kohakutou candy, ate a few pieces, diarrhea, and ibs made it worse."
"TIFU by accidentally outing my friend
So earlier i (16m) had gotten into an argument with one of my classmates because he talked about taking his shirt off in class, and i had pretty much said i would throw up if i saw that, then we went back and fourth, and i said ""this is why people like Jessie (not her real name) are lesbian"" and i accidentally outed her to everyone. I had thought she told everyone but... i should not have made that assumption, as while my class is not as bad, my town still has a lot of homophobic ppl. Then she had looked at me and she had told me they didnt know, then I immediately started to feel horrible. I wish i did not say what i did, and tbh she really was not hard enough on me, all she said was that she was frustrated with me, and said maybe for today i should leave her alone, and tbh i think if i were her i wouldve blocked myself. I feel really horrible bc i never wanted to cause any harm, and I know what it's like to be outed as gay too, and i had even talked to her about it and now i feel like a total hypocrite.

Atp i ruined my friendship with her, and i hope i did not cause too much harm, i am an absolute HORRIBLE person and i wish i could take what i said back. I never wanted to cause any harm to anyone but i literally did the worst thing possible.

"TIFU by being an idiot who can't keep track of time (and apparently also doesn't know when to admit defeat)
My god this was a fucking saga. This happened this afternoon and I am so embarrassed lmao. 

I have my final round of mock exams for my A-levels this week and my second to last exam was today at 1pm. Now I needed to get to exams at least 15mins early and I live about 15mins away - my plan was to leave the house at 12:30 to get there bang on time. At around 12 I'd had lunch and I was just getting my stuff to leave - I then got sidetracked and didn't leave the house until 12:35 (my first mistake.) No big deal, right I'll just walk fast. At around 12:36 (literally just after I leave the house) a tourist asks for directions to the town center, I give her some - it's now 12:40. I think to myself I'll just walk really quick, we don't usually get ready to go to the exam hall until 10 mins before anyway. At this point I should have admitted defeat and just gone home and done the exam another day, but I decide to continue. This is my second mistake. It's about 12:45 at this point and I'm still around 10 mins away from school and I get a series of texts from my friend telling me that for some fucking reason they have decided to go into the exam hall early and that she's being told to text me to hurry up. She then sends me another text telling me they're walking to the exam hall and to run. So what do I do. At this point I really should have admitted defeat and gone home, but for some reason I decide my only option is to run. So, I run. Full sprint. In public. To my school. For the entire way. I had to dart past old people, tourists, locals, so many people. I must have looked like such a twat, with my backpack on as well lmao. 

I get there red faced, sweaty as fuck, and breathless at 12:50. I then leg it up to the second floor dump my stuff, take a piss and then leg it back downstairs. It's now 12:53, I run to the doors to get into the exam hall. They're locked, and some assholes in my year group refuse to get a teacher to open it. Fucking brilliant. I now have to run round the entire lower school site to get to the other fucking doors. At this point I'm commited so I once again start running, it's also lunch time so I'm darting through seas of year 7s and some people are jokingly cheering me on (which was as funny as it was embarrassing) and I hear a few ""run forest runs"".

Anyway I finally get to the other doors, it's 12:58 and they're also fucking locked. I spot a teacher and run after her to ask her to unlock the doors. She's annoyed, but does it thank god. My final humiliation is that I have to I step into the exam hall red-faced, sweating and completely breathless, but I bang on time, entering the exam hall at 13:00 (I mean I least I got there on time in the end) and give a thumbs up to my friend. I sit my fat ass down only for my humiliation to still somehow continue when some year 11s walk in - one of whom is my brother's friend. And it gets better - turns out I didn't need to run to school anyway as the test starts was delayed because our papers were incorrect.","I have terrible time keeping and had to run through some very busy streets to school to take a mock exam. I arrived disgustingly sweaty, red faced and breathless, and yet my humiliation continued as I had to run around the whole school to find an unlocked door and enter the exam hall red, sweaty and breathless only for the exam to be delayed anyway. I should have just admitted defeat when I realised I'd be late and gone home lmao",I ran for an entire day in public to get to my final exam.
"TIFU by running for Student Council
This whole story started when I was towards the end of 6th Grade but has affected me until as a college student. 

In 6th Grade, I was a very average kid. Decent grades, small circle of friends, highly introverted. One day, one of the members of our school's COMELEC (commission on elections) went to our classroom and said something along the lines of ""Hey! Whoever wants to run independent(not under any party) for this upcoming school election and get a position in the Student Council, get this folder which contains all important information regarding campaigning, elections, etc."" The only position available for our batch was Grade 7 Batch Rep. which means you represent the whole of Grade 7 the next school year. All of a sudden it was like a lightbulb went in my head; I wanted to run for Batch Rep. Despite my introverted nature, I always had the best interest at heart for the batch and I was never in any major case prior but apparently back then, that's all it took for me to grab a folder and look into how I can start my campaign. A few weeks pass and me officially running for Batch Rep. is now public. Of course, I had my small circle of friends showing me unconditional support but I had batchmates who literally went to my face and said ""OP, I forgot you existed"" or ""Hey! I'm not gonna vote for you because I don't like you"". I'm sorry but did I assault your parents or spat at your food? I know what I am doing was very much out of character but I felt like having the audacity to tell someone that is absolutely crazy. I ended up not winning and honestly, I kinda expected that: I was going against the valedictorian and the biggest nepo baby in the batch so I had no shot. 

Fast forward to 7th Grade itself and because of me running, I am now somehow ""relevant"" and ""existing"" in the batch and unfortunately, that resorted into bullying. Because I pushed myself into the spotlight of the school and with the way I was treated, it was like I was forced to become an introvert to an extrovert in a matter of days and as a result, I became socially awkward and cringe. That became the main factor why I was bullied so I returned to my introverted phase but even more reserved, submissive, and awkward. Everyday was another day of me being treated like a punching bag and in case you're wondering, I brought this up to my parents and they brought it up to my principal and the principal didn't do shit. A lot of empty platitudes like ""Hey Students! Stop Bullying!"" No action whatsoever. Remember those horrible things that some of my batchmates said to me? Well, in the election for that school year, those same people actually had the nerve to ask me ""Hey OP, why aren't you running"". What the fuck? Even if I truly knew what I was getting myself into, how do I answer someone when they ask me that question when they didn't even vote for me, hell, OPENLY STATED WEEKS BEFORE VOTING that they would not vote for me? All in all, Grade 7 was a very depressing school year for me and it wasn't any better in Grade 8. The online pandemic years were a double-edged sword, I didn't have to meet my batchmates who made my life a living hell but I also couldn't talk to my friends as often. In fact, one of my best friends fell out with me mainly because of how I was treated and apparently, it was ""ruining his image"" in the batch. Another gram of salt in the wound. I guess it was fortunate for me that things got better in Grades 11 and 12, I don't know if it was because people matured or people moved on or both but I was just happy that Grade 7 treatment was gone. 

It's been about 6 1/2 years since Grade 7 and as mentioned at the start of this TIFU story, I am currently in college but since my spontaneous running for Batch Rep. stunt, that has actually fucked with my confidence level for that long. I never took any leadership opportunities and I avoided any socialization outside of my friend group. In fact, that led me to talk a lot of shit behind people's back. As euphoric that felt in the moment, I never liked that but everyday, Part of me wished I never ran and I stayed very average and very introverted because that caused me little to no problems or at the very least, no problems that were to the extent of what I faced in Grade 7.",I ran for Grade 7 Batch Rep and it heavily changed my life for the worse.,I ran for Student Council in 6th grade and was bullied for it.
"TIFU by having sex with my best friends older brother
I (18 F) was attending my best friend's birthday party at their house. I had already planned to stay for the night, so I decided to drink quite a bit. I was making out with a guy around my age (19 M) for the majority of the night, and he kissed me goodbye once he had to leave late into the night. My best friend's older brother (26 M) was sitting next to me when it happened, and started teasing me about the guy that had just left. He then started to kiss me and it got heated quickly as both of us were very drunk. Before I knew it, he carried me to a room and we had consensual sex, but he also took my virginity. During this, I sobered up a bit and we ended up chatting afterwards about how I was 18, he had just had sex with his siblings best friend etc, and we fell asleep cuddling. I woke up about 2 hours later before everyone else, still naked but covered by blankets. My best friend was clearly unaware that anything had happened, and they trusted their brother enough to share a bed with me since we all knew each other for so long. After eating breakfast and chilling with everyone, some of us took naps in the same room as we were all recovering from hangovers before continuing our days. During this nap time, my friend's older brother kept grinding on me and stealing kisses as we shared a bed again, and I let it happen. I finally left the house a few hours ago and I’m starting to realize how fucked up the situation is. My best friend and I treat each other like family, and that also means I see their family as my own. I always considered their older brother as an older brother figure to me, and I thought he viewed me as a younger sister as well. I wont say I never found the older brother attractive, but I never thought more of it. I had known him since early high school, and he was already an adult at that time. I never thought he would be attracted to me, much less want to sleep with me, which is why this has become so overwhelming the more I thought about it. My best friend doesn't know about any of this, but I don't want to keep it in the dark forever. I want to come clean to them but I'm afraid of how they will react since they haven't liked when other people flirted with their brother in the past let alone slept with him. I don't know how to go forward with this, I want to be honest but I am so scared to ruin this friendship that has been built for so long.",I fucked my best friends brother and don't know how to tell my best friend.,I had sex with my best friend's older brother and I don't know how to tell them.

"TIFU by using dandruff shampoo for the past year
Obviously not just today. But for the past year I’ve been using dandruff shampoo because… I thought I had dandruff. 
About a year ago at the end of last winter I started using dandruff shampoo to try to get rid of those pesky flakes and when it seemed to help a little bit I kept at it using dandruff shampoo every time I washed my hair. Seemed fine. No problems over the warmer months. But after the winter started back up 8 months later my hair was mysteriously covered in flakes again. It’s been driving me crazy all winter and only seemed to get worse. Even right out of the shower I still had “dandruff” in my hair. Frankly it was bad to the point of being embarrassing, and I had to spend time in front of the mirror before I went anywhere trying to get the worst of the flakes. I was being hyper vigilant about cleaning my hair brushes, changing my pillowcases, I even bought an air filter in case dust was contributing to the problem. 
Last week I finally had enough and started doing some hardcore research. Guess what I found? 
Apparently having dry scalp exhibits nearly identical symptoms to having dandruff. One of the only major differences is that with dry scalp you may notice dry skin patches other places as well. And the kicker? If you have dry scalp using dandruff shampoo can make it WORSE. Apparently the chemicals are harsh on the skin and dry your scalp out even further. I looked up some moisturizing shampoos and bought one right away. I’ve only taken two showers with the gentle/moisturizing shampoo and I’m already seeing way less flaking. Kicking myself because I could have looked this up months ago and saved myself a lot of self consciousness and itchy scalp.",dandruff and dry scalp both cause flakes but if you use dandruff shampoo when you have dry scalp it makes it worse. I was walking around with crazy bad dandruff for months when it could have been fixed by switching to a moisturizing shampoo.,I thought I had dandruff and now I’m seeing less flaking in my hair.

"TIFU and I'm scared I'll lose my cat
throwaway

CW (kinda): this is not a fun TIFU. This is a really bad FU. And it's emotional.

Read a lot in TIFU, but this is more of a stream of consciousness than anything. Hope it's ok to post

I actually messed up last Thursday. I left my wallet upstairs before running some errands, and since I didn't think I'd be up there more than a minute, I was careless and didn't lock our front door, which allowed my sister's very skittish escape artist of a cat a window of time to run out of the house. It's been nearly a week, and we haven't managed to get him back in the house yet. He runs whenever we try to catch him. And we're afraid he hasn't eat or drank properly since. Furthermore, we live near coyote territory and there are tons of raccoons out there (we've caught two already), and I'm so fearful for his safety.

Since that night, I have  
\- completely fucked my sleep schedule looking for him  
\- spent hundreds of dollars in equipment to catch him, and flyers  
\- lost time from work  
\- broke my phone looking for him, requiring me to get a new one  
\- ruined my mental health  
\- ruined my sister's vacation she was on  
\- absolutely destroyed my relationship with my sister (potentially)

I thought to myself, ""oh, I'll only be a minute upstairs."" But I didn't know my payment options were either two seconds to lock the door, or my cat. Two seconds, not even, and all of this could've been avoided. My week could have been very normal if I hadn't been so fucking stupid, and just slowed down and taken the time to ensure our baby wouldn't get out. He's such an angel, my favorite cat of all time. He was the cat that made me realize cats actually don't suck. He wouldn't hurt a fly. All he wants is cuddles. That's it; he's never asked a lot from us. And he's so scared out there, and probably so dirty and hungry. And the first three days we didn't even see him. When my sister and her bf came home and found him, I felt so terrible. It was my responsibility to find him and I didn't. If he doesn't come home, I don't think I can ever forgive myself. This is not an excuse, but I have ADHD and the mistakes I make just feel like they pile up and up and I feel like all I do is fuck up. I'm awful.

An apology to my sister I feel like just won't cut it. I don't want advice, and I'm certainly not looking for pity. It's just one of the biggest fuck ups I've ever had in my life, and I'm such an emotional wreck about it that my stomach is in knots. I just needed to get it out there.","Gave my cat an escape route and he hasn't come home yet, and my carelessness may cost me him and a relationship with my sister.","I was careless and left my wallet upstairs, which allowed my sister's skittish cat a window of time to run out of the house.

"TIFU by entering my dad’s room
TIFU by entering my dad’s room, and I think my entire image of him has been ruined, and I dont think I can get what I just saw out of my head soon.

Throwaway account. Today I was just studying downstairs and my mom made snacks and told me to bring it to my dad. For a little context, I am a minor and my dad is 56M. He transforms his bedroom into his office, which is upstairs. I usually enter his room to bring him snacks and drinks, no problem. Until today it happened. I brought the snack upstairs and knocked on his door, and I opened inside. I hear some music (he has been practicing drums to play with me since I play the piano) and so I assumed it was the song he was listening to to practice. I entered and looked around before my eyes locked on his computer. Normally it’s some spreadsheet or excel or something, right? No. This time it was a woman’s vagina. I am CERTAIN it was one because I am a woman and there is no way that thing could be something else. My jaw dropped and I let out a small “oh.” My dad turned to me and frantically switched the tabs. I quickly placed the snack on his table and pretended I didnt see anything. I left the room and he called out but I excused myself to the bathroom. I didn’t go to the bathroom. I’m panicking in my room. What the fuck am I supposed to do? This is a situation I literally cannot live with or calm down to. If anything, I have never expected him to do something like this, let alone indulge in pornography or something. I feel disgusted and I genuinely don’t know how to proceed with my life after seeing what my dad did. I don’t know what type of excuse he will come up with or pretend this had never happened, but I seriously don’t know what to do, or what to feel after this.

After I sat down and typed this, I realised that I have discovered some many weird things about him growing up, but I have buried the memories because I do not want to engage with those thoughts for I have prior experience with sexual harassment. I’ll list the most I remember.

1. I was playing with his old phone and discovered he has a private messenger account. I snooped around his chat and saw numerous messages with anonymous and there are some nudity videos or something in it, but I figured he got hacked. My memory on this one is quite blurry, because I was around 7-8 and has buried this one deep down, for I do not want to think about those things about my dad whom I respect.
2. My dad got a new phone and allowed me to play with it. I coincidentally went to the “recently deleted” folder and saw numerous porn in it. 3-4 to be exact, and they were taken from a CCTV camera. I dont know how he could have possibly gotten that but thank God it does not involve children. I was around 11.
3. I often sit in the front of the car and my dad would let me help with GPS and phone related stuff because he is old. Anyways there was this one time he wanted to show something in his phone gallery, he opened the photos app and for a brief moment I saw a woman lying down naked. My dad closed the photos app immediately and I pretended not to see and excused myself to sleep. After that I decided to investigate once and for all so an opportunity came on that day when I arrived at my home and my dad left his phone on the counter, so I took a look at it. There were 3 pictures of the woman and she was lying down, tied, naked. I didnt click the enlarge button to see the full picture, but inferring was enough for me. But I didn’t do anything about it because I was afraid to confront him. It happened recently.
4. This event that I caught him red handed.

There are some other occasions I discovered adult stuff on his phone, but I may have forgotten or have buried deep down. But now I am sure he stocks them up somewhere and it was my bad luck to discover them, or maybe I should tell this to my mom for advice, but I dont want anything to happen like a divorce because their relationship is complicated , our financial situation is quite rocky and whenever they argue I would suffer emotionally, (I have experience with SH, mostly because of them) and I literally cannot tell anyone to about this, so I’m asking for advice. What should I do? I have no idea how to proceed, to feel, or to think about who my dad is.",": Today I walked into my dad’s room and saw that he was looking at a woman’s vagina.

"TIFU By Almost Fainting & Embarrassing My Friend At Orange Theory
Ok, so this incident actually happened a couple years ago, but I thought it might be funny to share and to also give a little PSA.

Backstory: I (F25) was invited by my good college friend (F25) to go to her local Orange Theory gym as she had found out there was a deal for a special try-out class. I can't remember if it was free or if there was a small fee. It would be our first time going to this gym and we could decide whether we wanted a gym membership or not after the class. I agreed and she helped me sign up for the event.

So, I knew from past experience that I would need to eat something before going to work out at this gym to avoid any possibility of blacking out. (For context, I have nearly fainted twice in my life--once when I was in high school and had a habit of skipping lunch which was usually ok since I would eat when I got home but that fateful day, I had fencing practice afterwards. The second time, it was a few years later and the same college friend had invited me to attend a cycling class held on campus. I think I did eat, but I did not eat enough to sustain me after the intense exercise. I did persevere and finish the class before anyone noticed something might be wrong and went to eat with the friend afterwards. Both of these times, my vision was flickering between black and white while sweating profusely.)

Moving on to the event for Orange Theory, I woke up late but I did make sure to eat something given my prior record. I met up with my friend and we joined the class and started exercising. We used a bunch of the machines and did a lot of cardio. The trainer was very good. My friend kept checking on me and was surprised that I was keeping up since I don't normally do much exercise. I had a strong determination and willpower that kept me going, but that was my downfall as I don't know my limits. About 30-45 minutes in, we moved on to doing some more chill exercises and I sat down to recover a bit, but that was my mistake.

The moment I stopped to catch my breath while sitting on the floor, I started seeing everything in my vision with a blood red hue and all of the voices sounded far away with some things moving in slow motion. I was super pale and sweating profusely. I heard my friend asking if I was ok and I also heard another girl who was in the class saying that I should lay down and someone pushed my shoulders so I could lay down. I kept trying to tell the people around me that I was fine but words were not escaping my mouth. Someone called the paramedics and they came to check on me. By the time they came, I had recovered enough to say that I did not want an ambulance (My head was blaring with sirens from the potential cost of medical bills. I think the trainer had given me her/his electrolyte drink.) The girl that had told me to lie down had also said that it looked like I was having a seizure, but I am not sure about that. The class had also been interrupted but the good thing was that it was near the end, and we had basically tried out all of the machines and done the majority of the exercises. I felt extremely bad for inconveniencing everyone. My friend and I left and got some food at a restaurant afterwards. We have never gone back.",I did not eat enough food before going to an exercise class and almost blacked out. My friend will probably never invite me out again to exercise lol.,I nearly fainted while going to a try-out gym.
"TIFU by trying to surprise my (20) woman (20) at work and getting mistaken for a criminal
So this happened a few days ago, and I am still recovering from the sheer embarrassment.

My woman recently started a new job at a nice office downtown, and I thought it would be a sweet gesture to surprise her with lunch. She had been stressed, so I figured I’d be the perfect boyfriend and just show up unannounced with her favorite takeout. Simple, right?

Big mistake.

I had never actually been to her office before, but I knew the general area. When I got there, I realized I had no clue what floor she worked on. No problem, I thought. I’ll just ask the receptionist. Except… there was no receptionist. Just a fancy lobby with keycard access to the elevators.

At this point, a normal person would’ve called their woman and just asked where to go. But no. My brain decided that was too easy. Instead, I thought, Hey, I’ll just blend in and figure it out.

So I waited near the elevators, pretending like I belonged there. Eventually, some guy walked up, scanned his badge, and I just casually followed him inside. He didn’t question it, so I assumed I was in the clear. Then came the next problem, I had no idea what floor to go to. I panicked and just pressed a random button, hoping I’d recognize something when the doors opened.

When I stepped out, I was greeted by a hallway of identical office doors with frosted glass windows. Still determined to make this work, I started wandering around, peeking through windows, hoping I’d spot my woman’s desk.

That’s when I noticed people were staring.

Apparently, a random guy in jeans and a hoodie carrying a plastic bag of food, walking aimlessly through an office, looks exactly like someone who does not belong there. A woman at a desk stood up and said, “Excuse me, can I help you?” in that tone that really meant Who the hell are you?. I panicked and blurted out, “Uh, I’m looking for my woman.” Which, in hindsight, absolutely made me sound like a lunatic.

At this point, another guy stood up and asked who I was looking for. I gave my woman’s name, and they all just stared at me like I had grown a second head. Turns out… I had picked the wrong company entirely. Her office was in the building next door.

Before I could even explain, one of the guys muttered something about security, and I decided I had overstayed my welcome. I turned and booked it toward the elevators. Of course, the doors took forever to close, and I could hear someone actually calling security as I stood there awkwardly holding my bag of food, sweating bullets.

When I finally escaped and got to the right building, I called my woman and told her to meet me downstairs instead. I didn’t mention the full extent of my humiliation, but she definitely knew something was up when she saw how flustered I looked.

Later that night, she checked her work email and found out that an “unauthorized individual” had entered the wrong office that day, and security had been notified. That unauthorized individual was me.","Tried to surprise my woman with lunch at work, snuck into the wrong office, made everyone uncomfortable, got security called on me, and now I am probably banned from an office I don’t even work at.",TIFU by trying to surprise a woman at work and getting mistaken for a criminal.

I left my bedroom door open to try and let some heat in. I completely forgot that my wife and I had a little free time last night and a vibrator was left out. My 2.5 year old daughter brought it out of our bedroom and left it on the coffee table for my brother to find. 🤦🏼‍♀️ He has lived with us for almost 2 years in an upstairs apartment, but we hang out every night. This is the first time this has ever happened, and I’m horrified. I keep trying to tell myself “You’re not a regular mom, you’re a cool mom.” ***chihuahua chewing on nippies***",,Left vibrator in bedroom for my brother to find.
"TIFU by Forgetting I Had a Prosthetic Leg at Hospital Security
So, this happened yesterday when I was taking my daughter to the hospital for a kidney checkup. I’ve been an amputee for over a decade, so you’d think I’d have the whole security thing down by now. But apparently, my brain just decided to take a vacation. I walk up to security, toss my keys and phone into the bin on the conveyor, tell my daughter to go first, and then confidently stride through like I own the place.  
BEEP.  
The security guard looks up. “Step back and try again.”Weird, but okay. I step back, walk through again.  
BEEP.  
Now, I’m standing there, confused as hell, while the guard eyes me suspiciously. “You got anything in your pocket?”I slap my thighs, trying to be helpful. “Nope!”He frowns. “Any metal implants?”  “Nope!” I say, like a dumbass. Me and the guard just stare at each other. My daughter stares at me. The lady in line behind us stares at me. Then it finally hits me.  
Oh. Right. I don’t have a right leg. I start laughing like an idiot and lift my pant leg, showing off my prosthetic. The security guy shakes his head like he’s seen it all, and my daughter just looked like “Yep, that’s my dad”. Long story short, I get the usual wand scan and pat-down while my kid shakes her head in disappointment. Meanwhile, the lady behind me in line is absolutely losing it.  

So yeah.",TIFU by forgetting that I have a metal leg and unintentionally making a hospital security guard’s day a little more difficult.,I accidentally showed off my prosthetic leg to security.
"TIFU by forgetting an orange in my drawer
My office had a Chinese New Year/ Lunar New Year celebration during the fourth week of January. By tradition, lots of mandarin oranges were handed out along with snacks.

Brought two back to my desk and ate them. Later on, a coworker dropped by and handed over one orange to everyone sitting at their desks, mine included. Thought of reserving it for tomorrow or some other day, and placed it inside my desk drawer...

...and totally forgot about it. You could see where this is going.

Fast forward to today. Celebrated a team member's farewell luncheon, brought back some can drinks to store. Opened the drawer only to stare at a moldy orange with white spots, and some liquid seeping out from the bottom. 

And God knows when that thing has been tranforming, because it has turned entirely GREEN, yet strangely there was no (noticeable) smell, so I must have been inhaling those mold spores for a month! Gave the drawer lots of scrubbing with soap afterwards.",Forgot to eat an orange kept inside a drawer and it became green (pun intended) from mold.,"Moldy orange in my desk drawer.

"TIFU By translating a NSFW video on Youtube
As a side hustle I translate and put subtitles for videos that are NSFW/L, (porn, gore, etc. ) It's not something   I'm proud of but I do get paid well enough to keep doing it. One client commissioned a porn video, at first everything was going smoothly until my usual translation and subtitle software started to fail on me hard, day after day I would lose all my progress and that frustrated me a lot.

The deadline was coming soon and I essentially had two options: either tell my client that I had to cancel and lose money and time. Or find another way of completing the project. After searching for two hours with useless software I finally said ""Fuck it"" I opened YouTube Studio and started to work there. I assumed everything would be fine as long as it was unlisted. I translate and add subtitles, download, send and get paid.

An hour later I get an Email saying that they took down my video and gave me a warning, which was understandable. So, I erased the video took the class to get rid of the warning and continued to watch Youtube like nothing happened.

Today I get another Email saying that they closed down my Youtube account due to the video, I appealed saying that the video was already deleted but less than 10 minutes later they say they won't restore my account. Welp FML.",I,"YouTube Studio took down my NSFW video, I appealed and they won't restore my account."
"TIFU by watching the gabby petito movie and triggering childhood memories
Tifu by well the title says it. I watched the gabby petito movie and ended up triggering memories I wouldn’t have remembered otherwise. For background for the story: I haven’t talked to my dad since I was 16, reason unrelated but this matters. If you haven’t seen this movie, the part that relates to this story is the murderers mom wrote a note to her son (the murderer) saying she would hide a dead body if he needed her too and essentially helped him try to cover up this murder. This triggered me to remember that throughout my childhood I can vividly remember my dad saying to me (from ages 5-16) that he would cover up a murder for me if he needed me too/murder for me. He would always say it what felt to me so seriously. I could be remembering incorrectly as the memory was repressed and triggered. Either way, I think it’s a strange thing to say to a child. It’s slightly disgusting and disturbing to me. Am I over reacting? 

TL/DR: The movie made me remember something bad my dad would do and now I feel gross",,My dad told me he would cover up a murder for me if he needed me too/murder for me
"TIFU by misunderstanding the meaning of a ""midnight"" deadline.
This happened yesterday.  My daughter was selected for an advanced orchestra and there was an option to submit a recording for a seating audition.  The instruction is to submit by midnight February 24th.  I assumed that we have the whole day of the 24th to finalize it and submit by 11:59 PM to meet the deadline.  As you might come to expect, the submission portal was closed when I tried to access it in the evening.  I guess the deadline was 12:00 AM February 24th.

The FU is I didn't reach out and get clarification from the organizer and now my daughter might be placed in the back of the orchestra even though she worked hard on this audition.  We reach out to the organizer hoping that it was a mistake in setting up the deadline but I guess technically they are correct.

My wife is very upset with me as she asked us to submit earlier.  We actually made some recording on Saturday but my daughter wanted to get feedback from her teacher to see how she can improve and re-record on Monday.

Throughout my life during school and work etc when someone say ""due by midnight on a day,"" it usually means that one has that day to work on the task.   Lesson learned, need to get exact clarification when deadline is concerned.

TL:DR Missed a midnight deadline and not able to submit for an audition.


UPDATE:

I have been checking their submission webpage and there is a posting today that they are allowing people to email their submission video to the ensemble chair by today if they had ""issues"" uploading their seating audition video.

I think the wording of the original instruction was confusing to most people or they selected the wrong time for the deadline in their google form.  So this is a way for them to fix the mistake without admitting they made a mistake.

I promptly resubmitted as soon as I saw the post.  I think a lot of people got screwed and misunderstood the submission deadline.",,"Missed a midnight deadline and not able to submit for an audition.

"TIFU When my roommate lit a match to air out my Gas Bomb.
I was in my dormroom at my college with a terrible sinus infection. My roommate was an asshole but in addition he'd sell weed which is okay now and then but not when you're sinuses are being overwhelmed by that smell 24/7. I let out a gasser because I was pissed about all the terrible things he had done that I then had to deal with, like kicking me out at 3 AM to have sex with his girlfriend, not cleaning out a fridge and then making me clean it up when it got moldy after winter break, or having his mom call the police because she didn't know where he was, and then making me get the door to tell him to get on his phone. So this was my little revenge. I couldn't smell a thing so this was a little harmless revenge. Well I let it out and he did smell it. Aerosol didn't cover the smell, glade didn't either. So he lit a match, only the fire alarm in our high rise dormitory was very sensitive. The alarm went off, and the Fire Department was called. It was a monthly occurence, but our RA did tell us this alarm was from our room. So at 1 AM, everybody had to go downstairs, hundreds of students in pajamas on a Sunday Night. We had to wait until the firefighters could trace it and shut off the alarm. It was the dead of winter. For all I went through, I don't regret it.",; My fart caused the evacuation of a ten story building with over 250 residents.,Roommate lit a match to air out my Gas Bomb in the dead of winter.
"TIFU by asking my (M16) friend (M18) why he asked if 2 of my other friends are dating
Alright let's define some people (all fake names obviously):

1. Me (TheUn-Nottened): M16. Very extroverted, make a lot of friends, mostly through Jill. In my 3 trimester of college.
2. Steven: M18, relatively new friend. Met him this semester, through Jill. Really sweet guy. We bonded really quickly over power metal and shared humor. Pretty close friends.
3. Jill: F18. One of my first college friends. Pretty close friends.
4. Evelyn: Fmid20s, older friend. Met her through Jill. She's pretty cool, great at videogames. Not as close, but we hang out a lot.
5. David: Mmid20s, also older friend. He is currently dating Evelyn. We don't hang out a lot, but hes a cool guy. Mostly irrelevant to the story.

We're all in college.

Me, Steven, Evelyn, and Jill basically hang out everyday. We don't have any classes in the evening, so we hang out, eat together, play games, etc. Most of them knew eachother when they were younger, so im the odd one out. But we're good friends. We're a little friend group in a bigger network.

Steven and Evelyn are friends, too. If I recall correctly, steven had a photo of them 2 as his Profile pic for a while. I also recorded a funny video of them the other day. Never thought anything about it.

I also have something to say about the larger friend network. Most of the people are between 19 and 25, and are very close. Everybody plays games together, they go out to eat a lot, etc. There's also a very small physical barrier between the sexes. Resting on someones head isn't seen as a big deal, for example. I've seen several girls do such things with other guys. Basically, it's not a big thing. 

Steven randomly texts me, ""Yo dude, david and melanie are dating right?"". I respond ""yeah they are! It shocked me the first time too lol!"". I knew they were friends, but I never realized they were dating. To be fair, I'm very blind to relationships.

He says ""Mmm, okay"" and sends a sticker of a mildly dissapointed/mad face.

Then I sent ""whydya ask?"" because I expected something funny, and cuz i didn't really read much into the sticker.

He says ""No, just wondering"". Immeaditely contradicts himself by writing ""It's cuz i like her man, i think its pretty obvious"".

Pause.

I never realized he liked her. Shes like 6-7 years older than him. Now that i think of it, she probably sees him as a little brother.

So i'm thinking ""Shit, i just walked into a minefield"". 

He texts ""But i already knew, anyways, so naw"". He says that he had his doubts, but that he saw them today. and he feels a bit mad that she never said anything about it. Then he sent the sticker again.

I've never liked a close friend that has turned out to have a boyfriend. I have liked a close friend, flirted (very vaguely), confessed, gotten rejected, realized that my feelings were just a result of of confusing friendship with love (bullying issues), and restored the friendship before. I don't know what to do.

I haven't replied. I just left him on read. I don't know what to say. I don't wanna say anything wrong. I was thinking of a few options:

* Be like ""shit happens man""
* Try to be sympathetic, understanding whats going on
* Try to make him understand her perspective, like the little brother thing
* Explain the physical barrier thing
* Say that I didn't know he liked her at all

I just don't want any bad feelings to sprout in him. I don't want him to be mad at her, or even mad at David. Now that i think of it, he had asked me a few days ago what it felt like to be loved by someone (romantically). Im as single as they come, so I made the ""uh-uh"" shoulder shrug sound.

I don't know how our little friend group is going to be affected by this. Maybe he thinks i'm telling her about it. A little over an hour has passed since the original message.

I've also been told I overthink things a lot, so theres that.","Friend asks me if 2 of my friends are dating, i say yes and ask why. He reveals to me that he likes her, and feels a bit ticked off that she never said anything about that. I don't know how to talk to him in a safe way about it.",My (M16) friend (M18) asked if 2 of my other friends are dating. I'm not sure if I should tell him.
"TIFU by Trusting the Wrong Person
So, I (17F) am a senior in high school, and while I get along with most people, there’s still some leftover drama from my freshman year that has made things a little awkward in my band program. I don’t gossip or cause problems, but in a small town, once something sticks, it sticks.

There’s a freshman (14F) on my color guard team who never really liked me. Last year, she had a bit of a ""pick me"" attitude—she wasn’t a fan of traditionally feminine things, didn’t get along with popular or girly girls, and could be a little harsh with her opinions. She also made some rude remarks toward me, but I brushed it off, figuring she was just younger and still figuring things out.

This year, she apologized for how she had treated me, and since I know what it’s like to feel excluded, I decided to give her a chance. We started talking more and even hanging out. I genuinely thought things were going well.

But then I started noticing some red flags. She always had a boyfriend—always—but would still flirt with other guys, most of whom were older (like 18, while she’s 14). Lately, a few of those guys ended up showing interest in me instead (probably because I’m closer to their age), and every time that happened, she would get really upset and cry. I felt bad for her and tried to comfort her, saying things like, ""I’m sorry, but you have a boyfriend anyway,"" to which she’d just respond, “You don’t get it!”

I didn’t know what to do, but I still wanted to be kind. Then, I overheard her talking badly about me behind my back. That really hurt, but instead of confronting her, I just started keeping my distance. I didn’t want to add to the drama.

Then today at lunch, one of my junior friends (who I hang out with sometimes) sat me down and asked, ""Do you have anything you want to tell me?""

Thinking she was joking, I laughed and said, ""Yeah, I’m moving to Canada.""

But she just rolled her eyes and said, ""No. [Freshman Girl] told me you’ve been going around telling people that I’m dating [Quiet Junior Guy].""

I've checked in with my other friend about her saying this and he tells me she's been saying this and was confused, because obviously I knew [quiet junior guy] was already dating someone and her and I were friends.

I was completely blindsided. I never said anything like that, and I had no idea why she would make something up like this. I wanted to confront her, but with a big field trip coming up—where we’ll probably be sharing a hotel room—I am not sure how to handle it without making things worse.

I really wanted to believe the best in her, but I guess I learned the hard way that not everyone is as genuine as they seem.","- gave a mean person a chance, she's ruining my life and I don't know how to fix it.","Girl I’ve been talking to has a boyfriend, and I don’t know what to do."
"TIFU The Venno Bandit
Over winter break, I competed in an escape room with my brother and some friends and had a blast! After we left, I went to Venmo my brother because he had paid for the whole thing. Let’s call me John Smith and my brother Rigatoni Smith. I found the first Rigatoni Smith that popped up and—like an idiot—paid without confirming the last four digits of his phone number. It turned out to be the wrong person, and now I was out $35.

Fast forward a week, and I was thinking about how to get my money back, so I decided to request a refund with a friendly message. However, when I went to hit “Request,” I accidentally hit “Pay” AGAIN. Now I was out $70 to this random dude named Rigatoni Smith. I looked through his recent transactions, and it appeared as if he hadn't been active in years, so he had probably abandoned his account.

Fast forward three months, and I noticed that he had a profile picture on his Venmo account. I sent the picture to my brother, who did a reverse image search, which led to an Instagram account with 10 followers and no posts—another dead end. He did some more digging and uncovered his Facebook profile, which contained his home address and place of work. It turned out he lived just outside of Indianapolis, and I am a college student in Indiana as well. He also worked as a technician at a plumbing/HVAC company nearby.

I decided to call up the company to see if Rigatoni Smith was indeed employed there—and HE WAS. Now I had leverage because if he decided he didn’t want to pay me back, I could harass his company and spam him until he complied. If worse came to worst, I could go down to his home with an army of college students and lay siege.","Fortunately, he was a good Samaritan and paid me back in full. The moral of the story? Don’t put a profile picture of your face on your Venmo account if you plan on keeping money that people accidentally send you.",Rigatoni Smith is a scammer.
"TIFU:  Mortified due to a reply fail.
Not even 5 hours ago everyone received an email congratulating an associate on 13 years of being with the company.  I congratulated them in a separate email letting them know that at my former company that was acquired, I had 18 years under my belt, and that 13 was a great achievement, and they were doing a great job.

They replied expressing surprise at the time there, to which I replied that both myself and another associate both were there that long and reiterates that 13 years was fantastic.  10 minutes later I get an email from another associate, copying the whole company stating they were glad that we were with the company.  Then, and only then did I realize my FU.  I had somehow re-entered the original email that went to 45+ associates, bragging about 18 years.  We were just acquired a few months back, and are all still feeling our way into everything.  The kicker?  The way the email system is set up, everyone is in an email group which you can’t recall messages from.

"TIFU by being from a small country, posting a stupid comment on an Instagram reel out of jealousy, and the person being interviewed seeing it and responding
Hi. Going to keep this vague as it pertains to an easily identifiable community from a small country. 

Today I was scrolling reels during my lunch break and I came across a video that showed some creators from the community that I'm a part of (and would probably only have one degree of separation from) being interviewed by a relatively well known national media. This media company has a lot of online traffic where I'm from, so is probably followed by 500k - 1 million people... (ie a good portion of the population)

Anyways, these people were representing our community to the greater population. I initially felt so annoyed that these people were being seen as good representation of our community as, in my opinion, the aspects of the culture that they highlight are tacky and appease audiences that fetishize our culture. I've also recently been putting in a lot of time and effort in trying to engage with similar aspects of our culture as those people being interviewed and gain a bit of an online following myself. I know I'm as talented as them,  but I can also see that they've put in more time and effort to build their audience and be successful at what they're doing. 

Now here's where I fucked up. I've been having a pretty bad time recently and have felt incredibly frustrated with myself, my career prospects, and my overall life situation. Basically, I was in a bad mood so I decided to make that other peoples' problems.  

 So in a bit of a fit of jealousy, I took it out on them in the comments. I complained that they were appeasing tourist audiences, that they were a bad reflection on our community etc etc. I wrote a really long shitty comment and I posted and forgot about it. I checked my Instagram a few hours ago and the creators had responded to my comment and fired back (rightfully so) along with maybe 5 other people coming to their defence. 

I now feel terrible and guilty and don't know what is wrong with me. Why would I try tear down people that are trying to get our community seen by more of an audience (even if I'm not a fan of their methods or style)??

I'm so disappointed in myself.. I am also worried that even though I've deleted the comment that this will come back to bite me in future, as it is a small community and at most they're only one degree of separation away. I know the Internet has a short attention span and I am probably the only person still thinking about it (hopefully, I can't imagine they have to deal with too many trolls but also I hate that I became a troll for even a brief second). But I also know that this is a relatively tight community and that I may have damaged some relationships by making a pointless comment. 

I feel terrible. I feel bad for trying to tear them down and i feel embarrassed. Its 3am and I can't sleep cause I feel so ashamed.",I badmouthed a niche creator in the comments of an Instagram reel out of spite and now feel ashamed by my actions and may have caused issues for future me.,"TIFU by being from a small country, posting a stupid comment on an Instagram reel out of jealousy, and the person being interviewed seeing it and responding."
TIFU by teaching my dog to ‘speak’… and now he won’t stop roasting me.,"Taught my dog to bark on command. He learned to bark only when I say something stupid. Now my girlfriend uses him as a lie detector.

So, I (27M) have a 3-year-old German Shepherd named Tank. He’s smart, but stubborn. A month ago, I decided to teach him to “speak” on command. Classic trick, right?

   - Bark.

   - “Lies! I’m a saint!”

Now she uses him to fact-check everything.

    -“Did you really ‘accidentally’ like your ex’s Instagram post?”

    - BARK.

    - “Tank says jail.”

Worst part? He’s started barking at me unprompted.

So I got new glasses about two months ago. My partner and I went to our exams together and I picked out this cute pair of wine colored frames. Before then I would just pick the same brown frames every year but decided this time I wanted to switch it up. Within about two weeks I was starting to have issues seeing, squinting and having to focus to read most things, as well as getting headaches. I was honestly worried because I had just gotten glasses, how could my vision have gotten this bad so quickly? Even worrying I might have some underlying condition like diabetes. Well I sat down tonight after work mentioning to my partner ""dang I guess I have to go back to the eye doctor because I can't see already."" He looks over at me and says ""oh yeah I found your glasses on the table today and was wondering why you wore your old ones today."" And hands me my pink frames.

"TIFU_My Bhang Trip: Forgot Reality, Texted My Crush, and Became a Floating Astronaut
**","**: Ate bhang-laced prasad, turned into a forgetful ghost who autopiloted dinner, sent cryptic texts to my crush, and floated through spacetime. Mosquito coils were framed.

**The Full Saga**:  
*Mahashivratri night*. Temple prasad = a sketchy green milkshake (*bhang*) and sugar-bomb halwa. Me, spiritually motivated: *“Bottoms up!”*

**Phase 1: The Unraveling**  
Back home, I lit a mosquito coil (closed room, because why not?) and promptly lost my grip on reality:

* **Memory.exe has stopped**: Forgot I’d eaten dinner *while eating dinner*. My brain: *“Is this a replay or a glitch?”*
* **Background noise**: Felt like I was in a movie montage—voices around me, but I was cruising on autopilot.
* **Shaky hands**: Typing felt like playing *Operation* during an earthquake.

**Phase 2: The Descent**  
My body and mind staged a mutiny:

* **Heart**: Pounding like it was auditioning for *Whiplash 2*.
* **Brain**: Switched between *“I am one with the cosmos”* and *“I’ve been kidnapped by aliens.”*
* **Self-control attempts**: Tried to “snap back” by staring at walls and repeating *“I am a functional human”*. Spoiler: It didn’t work.

**Phase 3: The Crush Text Crisis**  
In a moment of cosmic bravery (or idiocy), I texted my crush:

* **Message**: Something poetic like *“Do you ever feel… untethered?”* 🌌
* **Regret**: Instant. But hey, at least I didn’t FaceTime her to explain the meaning of quasars.

**Phase 4: The Floating Finale**  
Gave up and surrendered to the chaos:

* **Sleep attempt**: Felt like free-floating through space, no spacesuit required.
* **Inner monologue**: *“I am a marshmallow. The bed is a cloud. This is fine.”*

**Today’s Update**:

* **Crush Damage Control**: “So… temple prasad got me philosophical last night. Let’s blame Shiva?” 🙏
* **Physical State**: Minor head spins, but mostly back to Earth. Mentally? Just cringe-laughing at my high diary entries (*“Note to self: Mosquitoes are government spies”*).

**Lessons Learned**:

1. **Bhang + Sugar = Memory deletion + astronaut training**.
2. **Crush texts should require a sobriety test**.
3. **Mosquito coils are innocent. Mostly**.

**To My Fellow Cosmic Travelers**:  
Who else has a “first time” story where you:

* Autopiloted basic tasks like a Sims character?
* Sent texts you now want to yeet into the sun?
* Became convinced you’d unlocked interstellar travel?

"TIFU by taking an edible for the first time
Today I messed up big time. Let me set the scene. You’re 19 years old and going on 4 years of chronic back pain. Getting rather depressed, you decide that instead of doing something horrible, you will instead do something slightly less horrible, and try cannabis (in a state with medical card 18+ without 21+). You pride yourself on being a goody-two-shoes, and don’t drink, smoke, or vape. In fact, you never have. (Yes, I’m serious)

These past couple weeks, I have been spiraling. My health is getting worse, and I am in more pain due to my back daily. I’m in school and constantly studying and cursing for being unable to focus because of my back. I reached the conclusion that this is a rational decision that I am making and I have considered my options and opinions. So, I ask my friend to buy us gummies. She has partaken before, so I let her pick our gummies out. I paid her (did not know gummies are so cheap?) and we got the goods.

I got two brands, both indica with CBD and THC. One came with 10, 20mg gummies. The second with 20, 10mg gummies. Both are blue razz. Both look similar. I trust my friend.

I take half of a gummy. She says set a 45 minute timer. This is where I’m about to fuck up big time. There are so many places I just make the situation worse. I set the timer. She is talking to me. I start to feel just slightly more giggly and out of it. It has been three minutes. I think I’m screwed that this point. I don’t want to freak out on my friend. So even though she asked me to let her know when I feel it, I don’t let her know. This is also because I didn’t know that it could kick in that fast, and thought it was just placebo. It’s eleven minutes in. I tell her I can feel it. She laughs “girl I think you’re tripping” (not actually tripping yet, she is saying I am imagining it). 

At 30 minutes, my back pain is starting to go away. I’m definitely giggly. I do not know why, but here she asks me if I need more. Girl. She gives me the other half. I thought this meant she was telling me to take the whole half, so I start to bite into it. She looks at me funny but I could be just imagining it. She has taken 10mg at this point. Shes starting to be giggly too.

It’s not even 45 minutes in when I decide I need to head back to my room, I am REALLY feeling it. My vision is weird but I don’t tell her that. My limbs are heavy. My eyes have been drooping uncontrollably.

I get in my room, and things are fuzzy in my memory now. My head has had a lot of pressure in it for a few minutes. I need an ice pack. I know that I called my boyfriend and started talking. This is where things are getting weird. I feel like I have been talking for forever and no time at all. “I need you to keep talking” and “my mind is repeating like every five seconds I don’t remember what I am saying”. He’s laughing at me. Hard. Ouch.

I am kind of starting to panic but I’m holding it together. I get up and unlock my door in case I need my friend to come to me.  My boyfriend says I’m being funny. I’m crawling into bed, starting to fear for what is about to happen. My mind is racing and the words are going through my brain and I am trying to speak and also know what I’m trying to say. My mind starts doing a math equation. 20 gummies, 200mg in the package. Wait. 20 gummies? No, 20 serving sizes. Serving sizes? They are 1- oh shoot. 1/2 gummy. One of the packages was 1/2 gummy serving sizes. Why. 

My mind is delaying and repeating and I can’t stop saying words and singing a song I can’t remember which. I’m reaching for my phone to sos my friend. She isn’t opening it. I walk to my door and just say her name through it. 

“I took too much”

“I told you the gummies were 20mg”

Not quite.

My boyfriend is laughing and she’s reassuring me. I’m trying to keep it cool on the outside. I think I might be dying. 

She leaves, I was practically begging her in my mind to walk out so I could crash. Omg I love her but sometimes she doesn’t stop talking even when I can barely keep breathing.

Goodnight. Well. Not yet. I trip hard for 2-3 hours.

I won’t go into detail right now. But I think God reached out to me. Please don’t make fun of me. I feel rejuvenated and happy. I also think I almost died. I was fighting for my life. I’ll probably add more details in the morning. Yes, this just happened in the past 5 hours. I’m still gone but at least I’m alive. Oh my gosh. If I can’t remember all of this in the morning just know it feels like the funniest story, even though I think I was just tortured for what felt like an eternity.

In the end, TIFU by trying a gummy for the first time, trusting mine and my friend’s math, taking a second bite after not even the full kick in duration of the gummy (45-60min) something I KNOW not to do, not telling my friend that I felt the effects real quick, not keeping her in my room with me, and more I’m sure I’ll realize. Lesson learned. In the beginning of the day I was telling her I would do 2.5-5. Nothing crazy. I accidentally consumed 20mg my first time.",TIFU by taking an edible for the first time.

"TIFU by completely misreading a job posting and missing out on a promotion opportunity
So, this happened today and yeah, I’m still kicking myself over it.



For some context, I’ve been working at my current job since 2022, and there was an opening for a Level 2 (L2) position—basically a step up from where I am now. I had previously applied for this role in early 2023 and didn’t place very high (around 17th out of 28-30 people), but since then, I’ve improved a lot and felt like I would've had a better shot this time around.



Cue the f\*\*\* up.



The email for the L2 positions came through on January 10th… when I was at home sick with a very heavy head cold, half-out-of-it, and probably not thinking straight. The job posting read something like this:



“Positions available for Team Lead, Level 2, and on the Offsite Team.""



My sick-brain read it like this: “The Level 2 role is for the Offsite Team”—which isn’t my department ( also, I don't drive. ) So, I just sighed, thought “ah well, not for me,” and went back to nursing my cold.



Fast forward to today after the interviews were already done and dusted, wondering why I never heard about this, I decide to re-read the email ( while not sick this time ) and realized it actually meant they were hiring for three roles: Team Lead, Level 2, **and** Offsite Team positions. Meaning—I could’ve and should’ve applied for the L2 role.



By the time I realised this? Too late. The deadline was long passed, interviews were over, decisions made, and there’s no do-over. To make things worse, it’ll likely be 18 months ( probably longer ) before another opportunity like this comes around.



To top it off, I have a colleague in another department who’s always cheering me on to go for these roles. She’s going to absolutely freak at me ( affectionately ) when I tell her I didn’t apply because I misread the email. I can already hear her saying, “Why didn’t you double-check?!”



In my defence, whoever wrote the original email did a bad job with the grammar as something like that could be easily misread if you're not thinking straight ( like I was. ) And it wouldn't suprised if someone of the staff doing the interviews were left wondering why I *didn't* apply.



So yeah… TIFU by being sick, misreading an important email, and effectively shooting myself in the foot for the next year and a half.

"TIFU by telling my coworker he looks like Joe Dirt
I'm still cringing thinking about this, so I'll keep it short. I'm pretty much face blind, I often mix up people that look similar or don't recognize pictures of celebrities, I only bring this up to say that my opinion is very unreliable.

I have a coworker that, in my opinion, looks a lot like Joe Dirt from the movie Joe Dirt. Mullet, same facial hair, same color hair, but that's about where it ends apparently (I can't tell). I'm not an idiot, I can recognize that being compared with such a quintessential hillbilly could be considered offensive, so I would never tell him willingly. That's where the FU comes in.

I told another coworker about this because I thought it was funny, and he found it funny as well. Funny enough to bring it up when we were all standing together talking at the end of the day. It was my fault to be honest, I was drawn towards the conversation after hearing a few words that might've indicated the subject to be celebrity lookalikes and was subconsciously hoping for an opening to bring it un in a non-offensive way I think. 

Unfortunately, the conversation went pretty much like this: 

coworker: ""yeahh he looks a little bit like John Wick, hey who was that guy you said he looked like the other day? it was funny but I don't remember who you said""

me: ""ummmmmm I guess I'll pull up a picture"" 

I'll add the specific image if you guys want but you can just google ""Joe Dirt"". It was the worst possible one to choose from that I picked. Anyways, he looked so offended- he didn't outwardly show it but was clearly very sad at the thought that he might be seen like that. I feel horrible because I've been in that exact same situation with a movie character comparison and I could tell he did not feel good about it. 

I would've been happy taking that to the grave but my coworker had to bring it up smh. Should I apologize or just forget about it, also am just overthinking it?

TL:DR don't tell someone they remind you of an often made fun of character of you still want to be friends with them.",,I told my coworker he looks like Joe Dirt from the movie Joe Dirt and he was offended. Should I apologize or just forget about it?
"TIFU By Trying To Help My Mom Get A Partial Refund
TIFU by trying to help my mom get a partial refund of $63 from U-Haul.

First time posting on Reddit so here it goes.

The issue is currently still ongoing, but I am hopeful that it will be resolved. It is a bit long so bear with me.

My mother (F54) and I (F28) rented a U-Haul to transport some pallets of flooring to a house that needed renovation. The first time we went to this location was back in January for the same reason above. The trip in January went well even though it was our first time ever renting a truck because the employee (Daniel) was very helpful and nice. Daniel helped us with all of the paperwork and also showed us how to start the truck and where the emergency brake was. My mother was very happy and proudly told some of her friends and coworkers that she had successfully driven a big moving truck like this for the first time ever.

The issue occurred the second time we went to rent a truck. A different employee (Syed) had helped us with the paperwork and we estimated the trip to take about 18 miles but since we were not completely sure, he put it down for 20 miles instead which we were fine with. We also got the higher rate to have the deadline changed to the day after as we were not sure if we could finish moving the items in time. We had signed the contract around 1:30 PM and ended up returning the truck later that same day around 7 PM. I had also read reviews on the place previously and remembered to take before and after photos of the dashboard that had the mileage and fuel gauge which turned out to be very much needed. I did this for both trips.

The original contract's estimated amount to be paid was about $86, but we were charged higher than expected ($145); when we called to check, they informed us that they charged us for the amount of fuel missing from the fuel gauge shown on the contract. The problem was the fuel gauge on the contract was wrong--we had received the keys for the truck with a fuel gauge around 1/4 and returned the truck with a similar fuel gauge around 1/4. The contract we had signed showed that the initial fuel gauge was supposed to be 5/8. Since I had the photos of before and after the trip, they told me that I could go in and show them the pictures and they would give me a refund of the extra amount charged.

I drove there with my original contract and showed the assistant manager (Crystal) the photos, and she attempted to fix the issue. She first questioned me and told me that apparently there was supposed to be a link that should have been sent to the phone on file and that we were supposed to confirm that the mileage and fuel gauge were correct since there was a way to fix it on there. I told her that it was our second time ever renting a truck and Syed had never told us about this link, which was true. (I think maybe we got lucky the first time that it was correct or Daniel had checked it himself when he came out to help us with starting the truck.)

Crystal then proceeded to redo the return and also got the authorization from the boss/actual manager (Noel) there to confirm. She input all of the new info with the photos I provided to her showing the mileage and fuel gauge. This is where I slightly fucked up. I did not realize at the time, but she had messed up the refund process somewhere as we somehow got charged an extra $0.83 instead of getting a refund. I had seen all of the interactions between the staff and had also approved the refund of $145 on the cr",,Rented a U-Haul truck for the first time in January and got charged higher than expected for the amount of fuel missing from the fuel gauge shown on the contract.
"TIFU by asking my cousin to see his anime figuRes
Obligatory: this didn't happen today, but a few weeks ago.

I (27) recently took some time off to visit Japan for a week with some friends. At the same time, my cousin (26m) was visiting another country, but arranged his itenerary so he could spend one day in Japan and be on the same flight as me going home (we live in the same city). He and I grew up together like siblings until about grade school, and stayed close despite not living in the same state until recently.

On the day of our flight i met him at the airport and we were sitting at our gate, chatting about our respective trips, when the topic of his one day Japan exploration came up. He and i both have kind of nerdy interests, and when he told me he bought a carry-on bag just to bring home the anime figures he'd bought, I was really curious and asked to see them. He said he didn't feel like unpacking his carefully tetrised bag to show me, and tried to placate me by telling what characters he'd gotten and describing the specific outfits they wore. that just made me wan't to see them more. I told him i would help him remember how his bag was packed and put everything away the exact same, how we had a solid 40 minutes before boarding so there was plenty of time to organize everything, and that we had nothing else to really do or talk about. With that, there was nothing left for him to argue with and he relented, opening up his carry-on duffel.

He pretended it wasn't there and simply moved it aside to show me the figure boxes underneath, but i would've had to be blind to not see the obvious fleshlight at the top of his bag. It was still in it's packaging, but there was a clear plastic window in the box facing me and i could see the opening of it had ridges and spikes and shit. there was also pictures of a busty woman in lingerie all over the box. I completely ignored it and focused on the figures he was pulling out to show me. When he was done, he awkwardly put everything away (not difficult, as the bag literally just had 5 or 6 boxes in it) by himself. I didn't offer to help him as i'd previously promised, and he didn't request it of me. He had this vacant look on his face like he was trying to astral project into another reality, and I'm not sure how well i was able to control my own expression. We were quiet for a while until I pulled some bullshit out of my ass to talk about until boarding.

Again, we're very close and each consider the other to be our ""favorite cousin"". He's comfortable telling me about what anime girls he finds hot or showing me sexualized figures/art, but that's completely different from me seeing a sex toy that he plans on using. Not to mention, we were surrounded by other people and some of them definitely saw the fleshlight, or at least the packaging with the barely clothed woman on it. It wasn't even a 2d anime girl, but an irl gravure model with her nipples out. I feel bad for pressuring him into revealing something embarrassing to me and the elderly strangers around us. I'm sure he never wanted me to know he uses stuff like fleshlights, or that he went out of his way to buy one in another country. Also, it was specialized fleshlight that had spikes and was battery powered, which i think is worse than if it had been your run-of-the-mill fleshlight.

Soon after, we boarded our 15+ hour flight back home. I felt guilty so I gave him my phone to play games (i had a lot of games that don't need wifi) for the whole flight. he got really addicted to a stupid puzzle game and hopefully it took his mind off the situation.",i pestered my cousin into showing me an explicit sex toy in a crowded public space.

"TIFU: By not eating
Tw: eating disorder/disordered eating, purging","didn’t eat for 35hrs, woke up with very low blood pressure then accidentally ate moldy bread.


Background: 23F, I’m not diagnosed but I believe I have ARFID. I’m seeing a councillor on Thursday. I’m healthy though (weight and blood test). I’m fine I swear, it’s a slow but steady improvement and this was an outlier.

So despite food being available to me (my dad literally brought home Chinese food last night) I ate literally nothing but like 2 cups of water yesterday which pretty much added up to 35hours of no food when adding the night before and last night.

This morning when getting out of bed I felt sooooo bad. Dizzy, nauseous, shaky, heart pounding, etc. basically my blood sugar was shit. I ended up having to call my mom to make me some food since I couldn’t cook.

While I’m waiting for the rice soup my mom made me a banana/nutella FT to get some carbs in. My parents are not very good with food safety and the bread bin is god awful. I routinely will go in a pull out like 3 bags of mouldy bread ends. And so I usually take more caution. While eating I smelt mould in my FT I unusually brushed it off (I’m pretty anxious about that stuff) and took a few more bites before I caved and checked the bin. The bread had some spots. I immediately threw up, and now I’m here with my rice soup and a gainer shake lol. My blood sugar is better now though.",you're not eating right
"TIFU by underestimating 22 flights of stairs
The elevators were crowded coz quite a few were being fixed so there was a super long line but I was also late AF so I thought to myself, the stairs must be faster so I chose to go up. I needed to get to floor 22.

Im honestly not athletic at all but I've been working out moderately to lose some weight plus I walk a lot so my legs are pretty strong so I subconsciously challenged myself to go from ground floor to floor 22 one time no breaks. 

I start and it's all good, I have my airpod in (singular) and the music is pumping, in 3 minutes I'm on the 8th floor I'm thinking it's not that hard so far I can do this. I get to floor 11 and all hell breaks loose my legs are hurting, I'm drowning in sweat, my thighs are clashing it is not what I thought it would be. I'm thinking of stopping but I can't (I don't know how to explain it other than it being like the ""step on a crack break your mama's back"" thing kids do. It's wierd but I just couldn't back down)

I manage to pass them but that was like salt in the wound. 

In the end I made it up and damn near collapsed on the stairs. I regret my decision, I regret my stubbornness. I was a fool, nay, I am a fool. I still had to work out today too coz my rest day was yesterday and coincidentally today was my semi-leg day so that hurt.

"TIFU by ignoring every red flag
this actually happened back in my freshman year, I had started dating Elaine, I hadn’t known them super well but we’d been together for maybe 3 months by the time this took place. It was the night of homecoming and we were going as a group of friends, besides me and Elaine, there was Anthony and Dillon. Anthony was a close friend of Elaine’s, we weren’t close but we had lunch together and I had no problems with them before this. We ended up meeting up at my house beforehand to hangout and take photos. I noticed Elaine kept pulling away from me, going out of their way to sit with my other friends. We were supposed to play mario party, but we only had two controllers, so we paired up into teams, but even getting Elaine to agree to be on my team was a hassle. We had been sitting in front of my bed to play the game, when Anthony started pulling stuff out from under my bed, trash, clothes, even a bag full of tampons. Btw, we’d never even hung out one on one so this random guy was just going through my stuff even as i was telling him to stop.

"TIFU By Letting Reddit fill out my first job application
This was 2 years ago and It haunts me every day and i finally decided to post it. 

My Mom kept making comments how I needed to get a Job but when I tried she would backtrack, I wanted to be a cook (still do) my original plan at the time was to work fast food jobs for quick cash and experience before working at harsher kitchens so I picked the subway attached to a Walmart. 

After begging for months, she reluctantly let me fill out a job application and after bullshitting through most of it goes to the bottom section, it asks me something along the lines of. “If your coworkers shift starts at the same time yours ends, but they don’t show up what do you do?”. I was left alone to do this mind you.

My orginal response was call the coworker, wait 30 minutes, then leave, but my obviously bad response didn’t sound good enough in my head. so like everyone that couldn’t get think for themselves, I went to Reddit, r/  Teenagers to be specific. 

I asked for help and someone said “When I stopped getting paid, my work stops”. I didn’t think twice and wrote it down, It gets worse, for job experience it had 3 past jobs, I crossed each section out and left a note saying “This is my first job”.

I proudly showed my mom, she wouldn’t give back my masterpiece of an application for almost 2 weeks, then I found out she showed my older sister, then my whole family found out.

"TIFU by looking through my mom’s phone and finding my parents videos

Lately I’ve been getting super paranoid about cheating/infidelity. Mostly because of social media but also seeing alot of cheating in college. I was at home last weekend and realized that my paranoia spread to my parents, meaning that I was paranoid they were cheating on each other. The accumulation of reddit stories, tik tok, and things I’ve seen made my mind flood with possibilities like “they are in their late forties, sex has probably dried up, and one of them is finding it elsewhere”. I decided to do my own detective work. 

My dad always leaves his phone sitting around and he has no passcode (I’ve told him constantly to make one). I went through it while he wasn’t there. Nothing. No weird apps, no secret text conversations, and the only social media he has is facebook, and there’s no activity on it. As far as I knew, he was in the clear. 

I then had to wait for my mom because she keeps her phone on her. Finally later, she went to take a shower and left her phone in the living room. My dad was in the garage working on whatever he works on. I took this as my opportunity to snoop. No weird text conversations. No weird apps. But there was a weird album in her photos app named “secret fun time 💦”. My heart dropped. I debated going into it but I needed to confirm she was cheating so I opened it. 

And that’s when my heart melted. 

Not only was she not cheating, but her and my dad’s sex life had indeed NOT dried up, but instead it was so active that they had dozens of videos of them doing literally everything. I quickly went out of the app, but the last thing I remember seeing was what I thought was BDSM stuff. 

I just went to my room and laid there feeling like I wanted throw up. The rest of the weekend I was super awkward and they noticed but I said nothing. And that Sunday I drove back to school. I’m traumatized, and I know it’s my fault for snooping, so this is my punishment.","I was paranoid that my parents were cheating, went through my mom’s phone, I found dozens of videos of them have sex.

"TIFU by not meeting Mathew McConnaughey bc I was taking a sh*t
Obligatory: this was about a year ago, but I've never shared the story besides with friends.

So my previous job was as a Lead Technician at a Live Production company (lighting, LED walls, sound systems type stuff). We had a client in Bentonville, Arkansas who works as a link between supplier and retailer to get new products into stores. They work with Walmart, Target, and a lot of other big names (they are actually the reason Dude Wipes blew up and is now at major retailers). 

This company was throwing a year review/end of fiscal year event for their higher-ups and at the end of the week, they had rented out an airport hangar at a local municipal airport for the last night to actually have a party and let everyone enjoy themselves. I was doing my job preparing the stage, audio, etc. for the event while the hangar door was open, and at some point, a larger private jet landed. Then, about 20 minutes later, a woman from the front desk (attached to the hangar) comes into the hangar and says ""I'm not technically supposed to say this but Matthew McConnaughey just landed."" 

Now I wasn't a huge movie buff at the time, but I was (and still am) obsessed with Interstellar, so if I could have met one celebrity, it definitely would've been him or Frank Ocean. Fast forward two hours, our event is starting in one hour so I decide to hit the porcelain throne before the event starts, as I can't leave my post during the event.

Optional Backstory:

Not today, but more so, a week ago I kinda ""ran away"" from home. I (15f) live(d) with my dad, stepmom and sister. I used to live with my mom, but I left (for other reasons) to stay with my dad a little over three years ago. It's safe to say that I don't have a typically, ""healthy"" family, but it isn't anything too serious, even though there have been several major events and situations.

I decided to live with my dad because my mom has her own personal problems and healing that she has to get through. However, she does not, so it is very hard to live with her, and co-existing is like walking on eggshells. There are things that she has said and done to both me and my sister that I will never forgive her for, and will never look at her, or even respect her the same. Being in a toxic environment has effected me negatively, in many ways, but the most problematic one is the way I interact with others; especially my dad.

When I moved in with my dad, it was the first time I was living with him instead of visiting, and it felt like learning a new parent. There were things my mom would or wouldn't like that my dad would feel the complete opposite about. This has cause a lot of disagreements and tension between him and I because I have become so accustomed to dealing with him the way I would my mom.

It's a bit more complicated than it sounds, but because of our inability to see eye to eye, we have become more distant throughout the months. It's been like this for a while, but recently, things have been at a stand still. He stopped yelling at me, lecturing me about things, overall, kinda gave up on trying to communicate. I have given up long before he has, so even though things were now awkward, at least they were peaceful.

Mainstory:

Basically my dad has accused me of smoking on many occasions and I've always denied or just not responded.  He first accused me of vaping, which I used to regularly, but now not so much (i don't consider myself a vaper anymore). He claimed he ""smelt the smoke"" off of me. When I explained to him that you can't ""smell smoke"" from a vape, he kinda said that either way, he knew I was doing it. But then he started including weed in there as well.

While I was in fact doing everything he accused me off, he never had any real evidence other than what he claims to have ""smelt"" (I normally smoke with pens, but when I do smoke spliff, I'm very mindful of the way I smell, but perhaps I have slipped up once or twice). So I always just say I wasn't or didnt say anything.

Last week, I skipped class and my dad got a call saying I was absent. He takes that seriously, so he was pretty mad. He called me out of my room and told me he knew. He then told me to take the trash out, which I did. And when I came back in the house he started yelling at me and asked me: ""what is this?""

He had in his hand a pouch that I kept my lighters, paper, grubba, weed, etc., in. He basically went in my backpack when I had left. He started pushing me and punching me. Thats not the first, second, or even fifth time he put his hands on me, so I was used to it. I'm not gonna say that he abuses me and all that shit, because he was right, I shouldn't be smoking. I know and knew this, but it was something I was willing to take heat for if I ever got caught, which I did.

But this time was different for me, because I told him and myself that he wouldn't touch me anymore. Last time I said that, I'm not sure he took me seriously. But I was very serious. Once he saw that I was taking his punches with very little reaction (I was blocking my face and head), he ran into the laundry room and brought out a broom stick. Wouldn't be his first time hitting me with an object, but first time with a broom stick. My stepmom tried to calm him down but he did not care.

While he was yelling, I ran into the kitchen and took out a kitchen knife. I don't really know what I was thinking, but I was scared and didn't want to get struck with a wooden stick. I wasn't actually gonna do anything, if I even could, but he did not like that. It only made things worst. He struck me with the broom till' it broke into pieces. And after that he got something else to hit me with.

He threated to ""break my jaw"" and basically told me to find my mom and go live with her. He was obviously kinda just saying that (he doesn't like my mom, and doesn't like me with her), but also not really. Either way, I already knew that if he hit me I would leave. Even though this time the reason he hit me was far more justified than the other times, I wasn't dealing with it anymore. I have really big bruises all over my legs and arms, and my ring finger has been swollen and cant move. So I packed two bags, and left early in the morning pretending I was going to school.

I walked until I found a random apartment building. A stranger let me in. I went to the top floor and put my stuff where the door to the roof is. I've just been there ever since and I don't know what to do. I know I shouldn't just stayed, but nothing in me is saying that I made the wrong decision. I don't regret leaving, but I kinda do because I don't know where to go from here. I can't go back because things would only be worst than the way I left it.

It's very hard to sleep, even though I'm not out in the cold, I'm still sleeping on stairs. I've slept over at my friends house for one night and showered there. But there is no certainly when I will next. I left my phone because my dad would be able to see my location (the parental controls don't let me turn it off). I only have my computer and have to wait till a location opens to get wifi if I need it. I went to school one day, but saw my dad's car parked in the front before I even walked in. So I ran and caught the bus before he came out and saw me. So I can't even go there. Only have a little money, which I use to buy food and bus when needed. I've met up with friends, which I must admit, is fun because I have no curfew or any limits. But I don't know how long I can do this for. I cannot go back. I swear it's worst for me than it actually sounds.

Any advice, or tips would be really appreciated. I don't know if I should contact my mom. I don't even know where she is, we haven't spoken, texted or called since I left. And she might call my dad to pick me up if I do. I also want to text my sister, because I know she's worried (I didn't tell her I was leaving, because she may have told my dad), but what if she shows him I texted her.

I don't know what to do. May have been a dumb decision, but I feel it was the right one.","My dad found out I was smoking and hit me, so I left and don't know what to do.","I (15f) live with my dad, stepmom and sister.

"TIFU by listening to a fictional national anthem so loud that people outside could hear it
So for context, I’ve been obsessing over helldivers 2 for almost a year. Mostly because of the satire and the community. I even have the super earth flag in my room. At some point I decided to check out the soundtrack of it, mostly for workout reasons and thought the national anthem of super earth absolutely slaps. At this point I have it completely memorized and sometimes sing along with it when I’m alone. Now to my fuck up, I have a soundbar in my room and while doing my chores decided to blast it so the entire house could hear it, I was home alone. As I finished my chores I decided to do the super earth salute as one does after finishing a task in game. So I just stood there, saluting, singing and waiting for the anthem to end, proud of myself for being done faster than usual, when suddenly my mother comes into my room asking what the hell I‘m doing and why I’m blasting the music so loud. Apparently even people walking by could hear it. I immediately shut it off obviously. And then came the awkward silence. My mom asked me if she should be concerned that I’m more ‚patriotic‘ towards a fictional nation than towards my grades even though they‘re pretty good atm. I told her no and she left.

"TIFU By Sleeping With Best Friends NSFW
Hi everyone! I am pretty dyslexic so I am sorry for any spelling or grammar errors. This is my burner account too since these people know my main account. This has been really freaking me out and might legit be the worst thing I have ever done.

I am a bisexual woman who got out of college less than a year ago. I had a rough break up my sophomore year and my program was so intense, I didn't have the opportunity to really dive deep and fix my problems until I graduated. I am finally in a place where I want to be with people and I have of been having casual hook ups while I focus on building up my career.

I pride myself on staying friends with my hookups, both male and female since sex shouldn't get in the way of building strong friendships. An old hookup of mine introduced me to a new friend group around a month ago where I met a woman (let's call her Gail) and a man (let's call him Dave). I knew they were close friends but I assumed everyone in the friend group was as close.

About a week ago, I started sleeping with Gail as she is also bisexual. We hit it off and became a friends with benefits type of situation. We all hung out a few days ago where me and Dave hit it off. Gail went to bed early and Dave and I stayed and talked. I found out he had feelings for Gail and made the incorrect assumption that it was a one sided crush. I told him he needed to move on and he made moves on me. I had never hooked up with someone while I was ""seeing"" someone else before but since my situation with Gail wasn't exclusive, I figured what the hell. Dave and I then slept together.

Something about Dave is that he is a golden retriever boy so after we did it, he got all puppy dog eyes on me and told me he appreciated how close I had gotten with Gail, the only other woman in the friend group. Apparently, Gail has had a rough time making female friends and I'm the first woman in a long time she has felt close too. He also called her his best friend in that same conversation. I immediately left and called my best friend to tell her the situation I got myself into. She told me to run and never talk to these people again but, like the idiot I am, I ignored her. 

The next morning (yesterday), I received a good morning text from both of them and realized how badly I fucked up. I told Dave we had to stop because I broke girl code by sleeping with her male friend and he understood but we still kept flirting. I talked with my therapist and we agreed to not to tell either party I was sleeping with them unless something got serious with Gail. Later that night, while Dave and I were texting some flirty messages, Dave let it slip that he and Gail used to sleep together casually. That was when I realized I fucked up.

I didn't sleep well last night knowing I was sleeping with not only best friends, but ex hookups. I also realized that Dave probably wouldn't be able to keep his mouth shut about the two of us sleeping together. After work, I messaged Gail and told her that I had hooked up with Dave. She was immediately pissed at me and asked for space, which I have given to her. I messaged Dave and told him I told her but then told him I was sleeping with her too. He got mad at me and told me he wouldn't have hooked up with me knowing I was hooking up with her. 

Neither of them want to talk with me and I am just realizing I may have actually caught feelings for Gail for the first time since I dated my ex back in school. I don't want to hurt either of them more than I currently have. Advice is accepted but I really just need a place to write out how I feel since this legit might be the worst thing I have ever done to another human being.","I slept with two people in a friend group and after sleeping with the second person, I realized that they were both best friends and ex hook up partners. I told both of them I slept with the other and now both are mad at me.",I slept with a guy's best friend and now I have no idea what to do.
"TIFU by forgetting my password
I was an art student last year. After I graduated I put all of my school work and portfolio pieces on an Lexar encrypted usb. For some reason I didn’t use my usual password. At the time, I recycled the password IT gave me at my job. I have since left that job and cannot remember the password. When I first got the password from IT, they told me I wasn’t allowed to reuse the password. I thought no one would ever find out if I used it only on my usb. I wrote the password down on a post it note and that it long gone. I thought I threw it out and dumpster dived to find it. At this point I’m going to own up to my mistake and email the IT lady at my old job to see if she keeps a log of old passwords.

"TIFU by letting letting someone use my hotspot
I don’t know who needs to hear this, but back when I was in community college, I had a boyfriend who was better with tech than me. He helped me set up a passcode for my phone’s hotspot, and for whatever reason, he chose “tittymuncher.” I completely forgot about it—until one day, a stranger came up to me at community college asked if she could use my hotspot.

I happily said yes and showed her my phone screen to type in the password. It wasn’t until she was already entering it that I realized what she was about to see. She didn’t react, just typed it in like it was totally normal. Meanwhile, I was starting to feel flustered, apologizing while also trying to figure out how to say “ I’m sorry my password is tittymuncher, it’s not what it looks like I swear, it wasn’t me!” without sounding crazy since I just met this person. Honestly, how do you even explain something like that?

TIFU by assuming the mouse was somewhere else,"I have a family of mice in my house and today one of them got to fly across my room

I work night shift and was trying to catch some sleep after a long night at work and before I went to get a late lunch with a friend. My friend called me to check the time for lunch and woke me up but NBD, I can just pass back out for a couple hours before I have to start getting ready EXCEPT there has been a little family of mice taking shelter in my walls/ceiling and mantle. And right now one of them is making noise in the mantle again… or so I thought. I have a peppermint spray that I use in the cracks when I want the mice out of the mantle. Proven fairly effective to get the mice to stop making too much noise when I want to sleep. At this point I will also mention I have traps out for the mice (glue traps and poison baits, stfu about non lethal traps because they haven’t worked either) and apparently the mouse was not in the mantle but in the poison trap. I picked it up to make room for the peppermint spray bottle and IMMEDIATELY noticed it was super heavy as a mouse FELL OUT INTO MY HAND. Normally if this had happened when I wasnt half asleep. I would have one more mouse down, idk how many more to go. But since I wasnt fully awake I freaked out screamed and threw the mouse at the ground. My second defense against the mice (my cats) were freaked out by my scream and absolutely NO HELP. I saw the mouse run under my couch and now I am way too wide awake to go back to sleep and am terrified the mouse will crawl out of the couch and exact revenge on me at some point. Gonna be a little tired for lunch I guess.",I'm an idiot.
"TIFU by kayaking with alligators
So my girlfriend and I have recently taken up kayaking in Central Florida. It’s been a great way to get outdoors, get some exercise, and see some beautiful nature. So last night, we decided we wanted to try a new spot rather than our usual go-to. A little variety never hurt anyone, right?

I start looking up lakes in the area and come across this old post talking about Lake Jessup. The post mentioned the possibility of gators, but hey, we live in Florida—gators are everywhere. No big deal. We’re used to the occasional gator sighting while kayaking, and they usually keep their distance. So, without much more thought, we load up our kayaks and head to the lake.

The first red flag should have been the looks we got when we pulled up to the boat ramp. People stared at us like we had just announced we were about to go for a swim with a bunch of angry piranhas. But no one said anything outright, and I figured maybe they were just surprised to see a couple of kayakers rather than people fishing or taking a boat out.

As we paddled out, I noticed how murky the water was. Not too unusual for Florida, but it was definitely darker than what we were used to. There were also quite a few logs floating near the shore, or at least that’s what I thought at first.

We spent a good two hours out on the lake, paddling around and enjoying the peacefulness. During that time, we noticed other people fishing along the shore, but everything seemed normal—no one was acting overly cautious or pointing out any potential dangers.

It wasn’t until we got home and started doing more research that the sheer horror of what we had just done hit us. Lake Jesup is infamous for being one of the most alligator-infested lakes in Florida, with an estimated 13,000 alligators in it. Yes, you read that right—13,000. There are more gators in that lake than there are people in most small towns. In fact, it’s often cited as one of the most dangerous lakes in Florida, and we had unknowingly spent two hours kayaking right on top of them.

When I went back to re-read the post that had originally mentioned this lake, I noticed something I had somehow missed—it was from 13 years ago. Which means either this lake has always been a death trap, or it’s gotten even worse since then.

I had no idea we were paddling around in such an alligator haven. For all I know, we could have been circled by them the entire time, and we never saw a single one. I guess that’s what makes it so terrifying—we were completely unaware of how many predators were lurking just below the surface.

So yeah. TIFU by accidentally kayaking on an alligator-infested nightmare of a lake. Lesson learned—always double-check your sources, do your research, and maybe stick to places that don’t require you to keep an eye out for prehistoric murder logs.","Took my girlfriend kayaking on Lake Jesup without realizing it’s one of the most alligator-infested lakes in Florida. Spent two hours out there unknowingly surrounded by 13,000 alligators. Would not recommend.","Went kayaking on an alligator-infested lake, unknowingly spent two hours on top of them."

I spent like 30 minutes in the mcdonalds bathroom dying of laughter so hard, that some random lady came in, heard my demonic snorting laugh, and very hurriedly left the bathrom.

"TIFU by missing my plane because I misinterpreted the time on my boarding pass
TIFU by missing my flight because I read the time wrong. 

I was on a vacation to East Asia and the boarding pass clearly stated my time for departure to be 2:30 - meaning that it was early in the morning. 

I was in a complete vacation mood, rendered my brain completely non-functional because I was just too cut off from the reality to check the time. I wasn’t drunk or high but legit didn’t care about anything else during my vacation time except having fun, gulping down food like a pig, sleeping, and just having fun with friends. 

I knew my flight was going to be on a specific date, I checked-in online too and even received an email that stated my boarding was at 2:30 AM. But I didn’t care to look at the time when I received the email. Then,  on thx day of the departure I assumed it was going to be in the afternoon for some reasons. I was under the impression that the airlines would notify me prior to departure. But there was no notification from their end. I even thought I had set an alarm few hours before the departure only to see that my Google Calendar was still in the draft state and I didn’t complete setting up my own alarm/notification!

This happened a while ago and I just can’t seem to get over it. I was having friends over for drinks on a Friday night. This specific crush is someone who I had been trying to get in a mutual setting so I could get closer to them, get to know them with less pressure. I was insanely nervous the entire day leading up to this night. I was acting jittery out of nervousness and excitement. I’m not sure if you’ve ever mixed those two emotions with alcoholic, but if you haven’t let me save you now by saying do not do it!!

I take probably 6 shots in the hour it takes before this man arrives. When he gets there he looks at me and my mind goes blank. I fall to the ground and he asks me “you good?” ; I run to the bathroom where my best friends meets me as I vomit into the toilet hoping this will pull me back together. A good puke and rally. After I’m done vomiting she sits on the toilet and wax from a candle spills everywhere (just a funny little side story) this was due to my toilet being wobbly (poverty is a hoot). We clean it up and make it back out to the living area where everyone is listening to music and chatting. I look at him in the eyes again and the anxiety, pink Whitney and champagne are mixing in my stomach. I turn around to walk to my bedroom to compose myself. I collapse onto my floor unconscious where my best friends lines my back with crystals. She leaves the room and I’m left alone with my crush who came to check to see if I was okay, I throw up all over his socks.

"TIFU: going out in public after a long fast and having GI issues
So last night I ended a 72 hour fast & if anyone knows the after effects of eating after a long fast, you know it’s best to stay close to home. But I thought my middle of the night stomach rumblings were it and I have shit to do. (Ehh, funny, but not)

So I’m out running errands and my stomach says ‘no!’ So I waddle to the ‘women’s lounge’ of a nice department store and unleash a fury from my behind that could have rumbled the building. I’m not sure, I may have blacked out for a moment while praying my continued flushing was hiding the gas & splatter I subjected this very busy restroom to. My poo sounded like pee in spurts. If you’ve done a colonoscopy prep—like that but stinky because it’s not all water.  And the smell…omg. I had egg drop soup to break my fast and an omelette for breakfast. The smell was rancid. Too many eggs….

The restrooms are set up with sinks on right and left as you walk in, then a T shape with about 6 restrooms on the right, 6 on the left. I finish my business and when I leave, the other 5 stalls on my side of the T are full. I walk out and a lady walks in and turns to the side I was on. There was only 1 stall she could go to. I’m certain she saw me walk out from that side too, so she knew it was me who had been in there. 

I finish washing my hands and as I grab a paper towel, turning towards the T intersection, the lady is walking to the other half of the stalls covering her mouth. We make eye contact. Long. Direct. Eye contact. I force a smile. She looks down. And I’m pretty sure I died, like my insides. Dead. 

If that lady sees this…I’m sorry! I’ll put some poo-pourie in my purse next time I fart that long!

"TIFU by ruining a three year friendship over my insecurities
I (18F) moved in with my best friend (18F) this last August. We have been friends for almost four years now. We bonded over music and a shared class in high school. We were close from the get-go, and hung out together constantly since we met. I did not have a lot of friends outside of her and our other (19F) friend. Every time we went out to see people, they were their friends who did not really talk to me and ignored me when I was there. I never let it bother me, as I knew I would be laughing with my friend on the drive home, and their opinions didn't matter. 

Moving in together was her idea. I was not opposed, but I knew how friends living together tended to go, and was scared it would ruin everything. I agreed despite my qualms. She's hard to say no to. We have two other roommates, one (20F) and another (18F). 

A little backstory: My friend had been adamant that she hated sororities and did not want to join one, and while I did not hate sororities, I did hate fraternities and knew it was not something I wanted to be involved in. To my shock, the week before classes start, she tells me that her and our other friend are going to be rushing for the same sorority. I was not given any warning, and she had not informed me it was something she was interested in. 

I am well-aware that she did not owe me an explanation, and she did not need to talk to me about it either. It was her choice, and I respected that choice. However, a little voice in my head was telling me that it was no coincidence that the two joined at the same time and changed their minds overnight. They are more than welcomed to discuss things without me, but this felt like a big decision, and I felt blindsided and a little betrayed that they never mentioned it to me. 

  
They are both gorgeous girls, and have always been popular, among peers and adults. I was not popular in high school, and was known as my roommate/friend's friend. I am on the heavier side, and have consistently struggles with my self-image and weight. Whenever I voiced these insecurities to them, they would laugh and say that none of what I was saying was real or mattered. 

After joining the sorority, they stopped inviting me to hang out, and only hung out with their sorority sisters or older friends who could buy them alcohol. My friend never invited me out after we moved in together. Safe to say, I learned to stop looking a social media when they went out together. 

My new roommates began talking shit about her the other night, and with the pent-up anxiety I've had, I began to talk a little bit of shit too. I never went too deep, and only spoke about her roommate habits, and nothing beyond that. I did find myself defending her, saying it was how she was raised. I got very close with my roommates and felt comfortable enough to discuss my insecurities with myself and my friendship with my friend. They were both endlessly supportive and understood. We only got closer and I started staying up until the early morning with them, just talking. 

Around this time, my friend started being closed-off. She would shut her door and not come out unless she needed to eat. Every night, I would knock on the door and ask her how her day was, and if she was okay. She only gave me one-word answers. 

One night, I asked her what was going on, and she got really upset and we started fighting. She said she was hurt and upset that we were all so close, and that our other roommates did not like her. I made a TikTok a few weeks before with them, and I do not really use TikTok, so I don't follow trends closely. She said the post I made doxxed her, and I apologized, saying that I did not think it through, which I didn't. 

I am aware I should have reviewed it and looked what the trend actually meant before posting it, whether it was close friends only or not. I took it down immediately following the argument. 

She has not looked at me in three weeks, I have not seen her face. My roommates are not speaking to me either besides the occasional greeting. I did not speak to them between the fight and the next morning, when they stopped talking to me. I am unsure of what I did to them, but I do miss them too. 

I want my friend back. we have so many memories together, and we were so close before this whole thing. I know I messed it up, and I apologized to her, and have made every effort I think I could've. I've given her gifts, tried to talk to her when I hear her come in, and even left nice notes all over her door for her birthday. 

I messed up. I know. What else can I do to get her back? I do not want to lose this over my insecurities and anxiety.",". 

Talked shit about my friend after moving in together, and now she won't look at or speak to me.","I moved in with my best friend and her two other roommates.

"TIFU by trying to make vodka sauce
I live in a residence hall and there's a campus-wide no alcohol policy. I'm not a drinker so whatever but sometimes I do use alcohol to cook. 

I was craving pasta with vodka sauce the other day, so I made plans to cook some tonight so I could share it with my friends. I didn't really think too much about the no alcohol policy.

We are not allowed to cook in our rooms, but there is a communal kitchen in the building. Nobody ever uses it but today there was someone in there doing their own shit. Didn't really think twice about it and took ingredients out of my bag, including the vodka, and started chopping veggies.

Big mistake lol. That person was an RA and she noticed the alcohol when she turned around. Immediately had to dump out all the alcohol and she recorded my name and ID so she could report me to the dean. Not sure what happens from here. ¯⁠\⁠_⁠(⁠ツ⁠)⁠_⁠/⁠¯

TL:DR had vodka out because I was going to make vodka sauce, instantly caught and reported for violating alcohol policy",,I accidentally made vodka sauce in a communal kitchen and got caught for violating the no alcohol policy.
"TIFU by ruining my first real shot at something intimate
So, this happened last night, and I (19f) have never fumbled harder in my life.

For some context, my best friend has been dating this guy, let's call him Alex (20m), for 2 months now. He's always had this flirtatious energy, but I chalked it up to just his personality until last night. We were all hanging out at his place, drinking, and at some point, I got up to grab another beer. Alex followed. I didn't think much of it until we were alone in the kitchen, and I realized just how close he was standing.

At first, it was subtle. A lingering glance, a touch that felt just a little too intentional. Then his fingers brushed against mine as he reached past me, slow and deliberate. The air between us felt thick, charged, like we were standing on a ledge, one push away from something reckless. Then he leaned in. Not touching but close enough that I could feel the warmth of his breath against my neck. My pulse hammered. My brain was screaming at me to move, to say something, to do anything but stand there like an idiot. His fingers trailed over my wrist, slow, teasing. My breathing hitched, and I knew, I knew, if I didn't stop this now who knows what would happen next. I completely panicked, but deep down I knew I liked, I was just scared.

And then

I sneezed. Violently. Like, full-body convulsion, nearly headbutted him type of sneeze.

He jerked back, eyes wide, and then, he laughed. Not just a chuckle, but a full-on, can't breathe laughter.

I stood there mortified, feeling my entire existence crumble. And to make it worse, I glanced toward the doorway, my best friend was standing there, drink in hand, looking between us with an expression I couldn't quite read.

The moment was dead. Gone. The universe had cockblocked me in the most humiliating way possible. And honestly? Probably for the best.

Because, of course, the one time someone actually wanted me, the universe decided to remind me I've never even gotten past the first phase. I had one shot at something-anything-and my own body betrayed me.","My best friend boyfriend was clearly trying to seduce me. Just as thinga got intense, I sneezed so violently I nearly headbutted him, killed the moment instantly, and got caught by my friend in the process.",I sneezed and my best friend laughed at me.
"TIFU getting a midnight drink
Obligatory it wasn’t today but rather a couple days ago. 

Me (21m) and my partner (20f) went to the Cotswolds, UK for a little late valentines getaway. We ended up having a nice day relaxing, went for a few drinks, had Indian food for dinner. It was great. We headed back to the hotel for a little us time and to end the night. 

Just before we fall asleep, I realise how thirsty and warm I am but unfortunately, the tiredness gets the better of me and I fall asleep. I end up waking up a little while later, head pounding and so thirsty. I get up with no clothes on and waddle to the bathroom to grab some water. This is where I assume I messed up because I only remember getting to the end of the bed before I black out. 

Next thing I know I’m coming to on the cold tiled floor of the bathroom in the dark (just my phone torch shining ontop of the side) floor covered in blood, glass and water. I can’t lie, I was terrified. I have these fleeting memories of my entire body tensing and locking, teeth biting down on my tongue not being able to breathe and violent shaking. It genuinely felt like it went on forever. I didn’t know where I was, I didn’t remember getting there or what happened. I was cold and in pain. Frantically looking around to find something I recognise. Then things just went black again. 

I’m unsure how much time later but I end up picking my head up off the floor realising I had been bleeding quite badly from my mouth and my foot. I just felt out of it but eventually it clicked as to where I was. I just sigh and begin moving to stand up. At this point I hear my girlfriend at the door of the bathroom asking if I’m okay. I just say I need her help. She helps me clear the glass, move me to the shower to wash off the glass and blood. 

At this point it was a little after 5am. My partner says all she heard was a glass drop in the bathroom and strange noises. She thought I was just making noises while bending down to get the glass so went back to sleep. We don’t think it was too much longer before she wakes back up realises I’m not in bed and goes to check on me. She checks me for concussion and ends up taking care of me for the rest of the night and kept making sure I was breathing throughout. I genuinely do not know what I would have done without her. 

I’m back home now and back to work but I swear to god my vision and brain function is worse ahah. Occasionally I struggle to put together sentences, simple addition and what not. 

The total damage wasn’t crazy, I believe just a concussion, bit off a small chunk of tongue, some cuts and bruising from the glass and falling. But yes, just thought I would share this little story with you all as my first TIFU, thanks for reading )","went for water in the night. Collapsed, bit off part of tongue. Cuts and bruises. Now sounds like a slight lisp at times when I talk.","I blacked out and woke up on the floor covered in blood, glass and water."
"TIFU by sitting like a dumbass
Sorry for the crappy formatting and my awful grammar since i’m on mobile. 

This happened from last night to early this morning. We need some background first for everything to make sense. My (16m) mom just got back into the dating field and she’s been seeing this one guy since march of 2024. I live in a two family house in the upstairs apartment. Every weekend he either comes to our apartment or she goes to his. This weekend she went by him so I was left alone. The rule is that if there’s an emergency i call my grandmother since she lives downstairs. 

I usually just dick around when i’m home alone and fall asleep really late.
I ended up getting out of bed at around 8:30 to do a paper craft since I saw a tutorial online and i was struggling with this specific craft for a while. I got everything I needed and i sat at the table. For context, I was sitting with one leg under the rest of my body so it ended up falling sleep. This is important.

Now usually when I craft I throw everything out at the end but tonight i decided to throw out the paper scraps I already had so it wouldn’t be as messy. Here’s where I fuck up. I stand up and notice that my leg is completely numb. I don’t think anything of it since i’ve walked with a numb leg before. I got a few steps in before i collapse under my own weight, roll my ankle and fall on the floor. 

Now i’ve had my fair share of nasty falls due to a medical condition but this shit HURT. I started crying from the pain and freaking out. I crawled over to the couch and waited for the pain to go away but it wasn’t going anywhere. I crawled over to the table, grab my phone, and call my grandma. She comes upstairs and my ankle is swollen. She tells me to call my mom, I do, and I go to the hospital. They didn’t think anything was wrong but they just wanted to make sure. I get my x ray done and the doctor comes into explain.

Turns out my little fall caused me to get a hairline fracture in my ankle. They give me a boot, crutches, and discharge me from the hospital and now i’m out of school until the ninth of march. I never did get to finish my paper craft and my ankle still hurts like hell.",I tried walking with my leg that fell asleep and i ended up falling over and fracturing my ankle,I fell asleep and got a hairline fracture in my ankle.
"TIFU by buying the wrong book for a child’s birthday
Technically this happened last weekend but I didn’t get the fallout until today, so forgive me. 

I was supposed to go shopping with my SIL last weekend but her husband got covid so she had to quarantine. I decided to go out on my own and went to Barns and Noble. When I got there I got a text from SIL asking what store I was at. I told her and she asked if I could pick up a book for her nephew’s birthday on Thursday since she was quarantined and wouldn’t be able to get out. I asked if he would like a book because I was at a book store and she said he was a big reader. Score! I asked what kind of books he likes and she only said “chapter books” so I didn’t have much direction. 

It has to be said that I am not a kid person and really have no idea what is appropriate for kids gifts when they are over a certain age. I also forgot to ask her nephew’s age and for some reason I thought he was an older teen. 

I was at Barns and Nobles to get the latest Grady Hendrix novel. I really like his stuff and I thought that “hey, Twilight was a thing so kids these days probably like vampires, right?” So I grabbed a copy of “The Southern Book Club’s Guide to Slaying Vampires”. A local scout troop was also there doing a wrapping donation thing so I payed them to wrap the present so my SIL didn’t have to. 

When I got home I called her and told her that I picked up a book and wrapped it and she was thankful and said she would pick it up on Wednesday. I did not tell anyone what book I got. I ended up being at work when my SIL came by so my husband did the hand off. 

This morning I got a call from SIL and her first words were “what was that book you got??” I told her it was a book about vampires and asked if her nephew didn’t like vampires. I then learned three things:
1. Her nephew is 11 
2. He is a bit of a scaredy cat
3. He absolutely MUST finish every book he starts

Apparently no one else at the party had heard of Grady Hendrix and the kid was a big reader so he started reading it. If you haven’t read it there is a scene where (SPOILER) someone gets killed by rats. The scene is not too graphic but it is still freaky. According to SIL her nephew has been having nightmares since he read that scene and refuses to sleep alone. My SIL is in how water with her SIL and this has caused a lot of friction. I told her she can blame me completely but apparently this has brought out some underlying family drama and now my SIL is not talking to her SIL or MIL. She said she would give me more details next time we met.",not all vampires are sparkly and teen friendly,I bought the wrong book for my SIL’s nephew for his birthday.
"TIFU by listening to RSLASH at work
I've been listening to Rslash for years now.  It's been part of my daily routine.  I've never had a problem until now.  I screwed up.  I'm really bad about keeping my bluetooth headphones charged at night and didnt.  I listen to Rslash and a few other channels at work to keep the day moving.  I wasn't listening on my headphones while driving to work and didn't check to ensure my bluetooth was connecting.  I pressed play on my phone thinking my headphones were connected and ...  With the four office girls nearby, my phone spewed at full blast a small clip from a video ""and she felt my privates touch her"".  This took place probably over 3 seconds and it was almost certainly one of the worst captions that could've been heard.  Everyone around me stopped what they were doing and starred.   One coworker asked me what the hell that was (probably thinking i there was the possibility of me listening to porn at work).  I dont nor would i ever do that (especially at work).  I told her reddit stories.  She asked if it was on my phone or company laptop.  It was incredibly embarrassing.   I still listen to youtube at work but have to be very careful.

"TIFU by crashing my brother's truck the day before I officiated his wedding.
I(F24) was visiting home from out of state for my brothers(M30) wedding he had asked me to officiate. The wedding was just days before I turned 25 and my brother, knowing I'd need a way to get around, generously offered me his truck since he’d be on his honeymoon after the wedding. The day before the wedding, my plus one (my old college roommate) and I decided to run to the local grocer and then to the recreational dispo. I had recently moved from a legal state to a medical state and had plans with friends later in the week so this stop was important.

After grabbing our groceries we headed to our next destination. While on the expressway I almost missed my turn and, without thinking (or more accurately, thinking like an idiot) I tried to catch it last minute. I ended up crashing into the guardrail, which bounced us into the other guardrail. Thankfully, both my friend and I were okay but the truck was a mess. 

Legally, I was in the clear after the police report was filed, but I felt terrible. I paid my brother's fee for a rental car as he still had to get around some before his honeymoon and covered the insurance premium to get the body fixed right away. Currently I’m repaying my brother for the increase in insurance each month, as they’re financially strapped after finishing school, one a master’s and the other a doctorate, and having a large wedding. 

The damage was all cosmetic, but it looked bad. This all happened the day before I was supposed to officiate his wedding while staying at his house and using his truck for free. That night was rough, I’m sure it would’ve been stressful even if I hadn’t crashed his truck, but now especially so. My now sister-in-law drove my friend and I to another friend's apartment who was also attending the wedding and happened to live near the venue just to give my brother a little break from me. That night we played our DnD campaign and I rolled a 1 on a death save. After that I went to bed. 

The next day, we all acted like nothing had happened at the wedding, as it should’ve been. The wedding was amazing and beautiful. We never talk about the accident, other than my Venmo transactions to him.","I crashed my brother's truck the day before officiating his wedding, causing a lot of stress and financial burden. Thankfully, no one was hurt, and the wedding went smoothly. I'm now repaying my brother for the insurance costs.

"TIFU by eating a hamburger during a screening of a bollywood movie.
in june of last year, i went to see kalki 2898 AD in theaters. for those of you who don't know, kalki 2898 AD is a science fiction movie from india that i honestly think might be one of the best movies of last year.

when i went, it was early evening and i had not yet eaten dinner. as such, i was craving something a little more filling then popcorn. as such, i ordered the signature burger of the theater. my grandfather had had this burger before and loved it so i decided to try it.

as i entered the theater, i found that there were quite a few indian people in the audience. and as the time for showtime got nearer and nearer, more indian people entered the auditorium. as a matter of fact, i was the only non indian person in the theater.

eventually, it donned on me. i was eating a hamburger. hamburgers are made from beef. beef comes from cows. cows are sacred animals in indian culture. that realization hit me like a fucking brick. how did that detail slip my mind!

thankfully, no one was offended and they allowed me to eat my burger in peace. as a matter of fact, i was welcomed with open arms.

PS: my grandfather was right. the burger was good.","went to a screening of an indian movie and ordered a hamburger, forgetting that cows are sacred animals in india.",eated a hamburger at a movie theater. it was good.
"TIFU by taking a mirror selfie at my dad’s barber shop
(2016, the era of Snapchat filters and mirror selfies...)

I used to tag along with my dad to his barber shop sometimes. One day, while he was getting a head massage after his haircut, I took a few casual mirror selfies with him in the background. No big deal. I was sitting there, being nonchalant, and it was just me and my dad in the shot.

As I was checking my pictures, I noticed a barber working on another client staring at me and smirking. I didn’t want to make eye contact, so I got the brilliant idea of using my phone camera to sneak a look at him. And that's when I saw it.

He was staring right at me... pouting, winking, playing with his hair while still cutting his client’s. I was disgusted. Why was this man flirting with me while literally holding scissors?!

I put my phone away, mortified. My dad finished, paid, and as I got up to leave... I saw it.

Behind where I was sitting was a huge mirror.

The man wasn’t looking at me. He thought I was taking his picture. The pouting? The winking? The smirking? All for the camera. I never went back to that shop again.","Accidentally made a barber think I was taking pictures of him while he was cutting hair, but he was just posing for the camera.",I took a mirror selfie at my dad's barber shop.
"TIFU by deflating tyres
I was cooling off with a friend after playing badminton. My scooter was parked nearby. Suddenly I saw the car parked ahead of my scooter bang into my scooter (it fell to the ground). I said ""fuck"" and mentally waited for the guy to pick up the scooter from the ground. But they just took off.

I packed my things and followed them. They were maybe 100m from the incident, caught up to them pretty quickly. I parked infront of their car, told the driver 'you just hit my scooter and dipped'.

The driver - 'yeah I didn't realise at the time but my friends told me'

In my head I went he's definitely drunk (I live a tourist hotspot where people from accross the country come to have a good time) and still didn't bother to reverse and put it on its stand.

I didn't feel satisfied with the response. The driver apologised along with three passengers. I still wasn't satisfied. I told them I'll remove air from your tyres. In my head if they were actually sorry they would've done something about it rather than bolting. I partially removed air from the back tyre. By this point the receptionist of the hotel they were staying at came for their help and started saying he'll call the cops. I said please call. He physically tried to stop me from removing the air but I didn't budge.

By this point there was going to be a congestion on the road so I decided to move my scooter. Told the receptionist I'm waiting for the cops and he said - 'I didn't call, you only call'

I took off because I felt like this was enough but then I something switched and I started following them. I followed them to the nearest gas filling station (2km from the incident) as they drove slowly with hazard lights on one of the major streets for tourists. Traffic wasn't bad.

I waited outside the station till they filled air (about 10 mins). Followed them to a parking lot close to the beach (5.5km from the station), and snuck around security to remove air from their tyres again.

Technically I followed them for about 7km to cause them some inconvenience because they didn't want to get inconvenienced by getting out of the car to pick up a scooter.

I do not mind the damanges to the scooter because it's already beat up and it doesn't seem fair for them to pay for damages. I'm thinking of removing air again in the morning since I know their parking space near the hotel. I think I've a problem.",,TIFU by deflating tyres.

Last night I was a mess. Drunk, upset. Had a heated argument with my family and was damn pissed. I got home and wanted to have sex with my fiancé. Like not the romantic one but borderline feral, rip me out of my head  kinda

We got into it, he's on top and I wanted to say something hot and possessive like ""you're my man."" But for some ungodly reason ""fucking animal"" was also floating in my head. My dumbass brain tried to say both the words and I ended up moaning, ""you're my mammal""

He literally stopped while inside me and asked “IM YOUR WHAT?"" I was sloshed but realised what I had said and tried to double down, ""you're my uh, my strong, hot mammal."" This man died laughing like he was gone. He literally rolled off me and laughed for 5 minutes straight. Still he got back into it and everytime he moved, he'd start wheezing again.

"TIFU by running in the teacher relay race
This happened on Friday so I’m still sore (both my body and my pride).

I am a teacher at a large high school. We had our whole-school Athletics Day on Friday and I was pumped. I was dressed up in my House colours, ribbons and face paint and all, and had a great day being a judge on the track. I think watching kids race around all day gave my 35 year old self a whole lot of false confidence.

The teacher relay race is announced. I’m asked to run. I agree, despite having slides on - no problem, I’ll run in bare feet. I also have not deadass sprinted 100m in about 20 years but I don’t worry about that - it’s just running right?

I’m up first, and the race starts. I’m running as fast as I can but I can sense I’m being passed pretty quickly. No problem, I’ll speed up. But while my legs start pumping faster, my body just… doesn’t. I’m all out of whack and almost in slow motion, I go down like a sack of bricks. Full flail, outstretched arms, skidding along on my face. In front of 2000 students, my colleagues and God.

Now I have had the weekend to feel all the aches and pains this absolute face plant has resulted in, and I have an absolute horrific case of the Sunday scaries.

"TIFU by telling a rabbit folk tale in a more authentic version
This morning, as I do every Saturday, I read to kids for a library story time.

In our program, we always try to do an oral folk tale with the books and all our 3 or 4 stories fit into a theme. Today's theme was hard work because there's a holiday in my country this week, the name of which literally translates as 'celebrating after hard work' (Mashramani).

I chose a folk tale from China that was about a rice farmer who abandons working his field when a rabbit accidentally crashes into a tree next to him and dies and so he eats the rabbit and sells the skin.

I considered changing the animal to something local, like a deer or goat, but ultimately decided that the point of telling international folk tales was to let kids experience a wider world and there are no rabbits where we live so rabbits would be kind of exotic. So I left the rabbit in.

The first sign that something was going wrong was when I mentioned that the rabbit died after crashing into the tree. The kids seemed deflated. Then when I said the farmer took the rabbit home to eat it, one 6-year-old said, 'Oh no. Nooo..'

Then I mentioned the farmer skinning the rabbit and more kids got an aghast look.

Thankfully, the rest of the story did not involve rabbits, so we moved on.

Except... Once that story was over, I started to introduce the next story, a book all about a family who fixes up an old house to live in it. 

But after missing it during a week of preparation, I finally realized my programming error. The next book was 'Bunny Bungalow'... a cheerful sweet story about a cute rabbit family complete with little anthropomorphic rabbits, including baby rabbits.

I did the only thing I could, which was pretend like nothing was discordant and just read it with gusto. Thankfully they seemed to get immersed after a while, but the start was a bit rocky to judge by the faces.",told kids a story about a rabbit getting skinned and eaten only to follow up with a story about a cute rabbit family.,TIFU by telling a rabbit folk tale in a more authentic version.
"TIFU by ignoring my girlfriend instead of communicating
So quick back story, it’s my first relationship outside of elementary school, and it’s her let’s say fifth. Basically I had no friends growing up and while she was shy and anxious she still had more friends than I, what I’m trying to say is I’m really bad at communication sometimes. We’ve talked about it before after a few incidents and I apologized obviously and promised to work on it. 

We had a misunderstanding yesterday, while we were both at work we discussed having sex last night when we were both done with work. Cut to me getting to her place, we played video games, talked, all that fun stuff. Anyway it’s starting to get late now usually it’s about time I leave, especially because we both have work in the morning, when she starts to signal that it’s time. Now it’s late, I’m exhausted and when I stopped at home to change I forgot to grab some things for that so I don’t really want to do anything anymore. But I didn’t tell her, I just kinda ignored what she was doing until I basically left while she was confused and upset. 

Now this morning we get to work, (I should say that we work at the same job) and I went to where I expected she would be, I saw her going to the back desk and went to follow her to say hello. When I got back there she had already dropped off what she needed too and I just missed her, I’m not sure why I didn’t turn around to go to her desk, or why I didn’t stay at her desk in the first place but instead I grabbed the paperwork at the back desk and started working there. A few minutes later she comes up to the desk and we say hi, it’s a short conversation and she walks away soon after. I then get a text saying “thanks for coming to say hi to me this morning.”. Now she’s the type to change you to u and use periods when she’s upset and all those things, so I knew she wasn’t happy as soon as I read it, now I got defensive because I did try to come see her, I went to her desk and followed her to the back, I didn’t see that I could have just stayed at her desk or even just text her saying I’m here or a wya. 

After that it was a few comments about how I basically left her on read for like 30 minutes before work, which I did tell her I was in the shower and getting ready but I should have checked my phone or at least let her know. Then last night was brought up, about how I ignored her which confused me before I realized she was quoting me when I said “I was tired, I was trying to ignore it” I apologized, but I guess I was apologizing for the wrong thing because next thing I know we’re arguing about how I’m okay with her falling asleep at my house but I don’t at hers, I got a bit mean and basically said well it’s not like you have somewhere to be most mornings. She was hurt by this and felt like I don’t care, said that my apology’s sometimes seem fake, I said “there’s times I feel the same” there was a bit more arguing and then she says “idk I didn’t cause this” which upsets me because I have issues feeling like everything is my fault.

 I made it worse then by basically pretending not to see her whenever I did see her, unless I needed to talk to her in which case it was short and to and the point. I tried to calm down and ask if she wanted to take lunches together she said sure, I asked what she’s doing and learned that her ex bf would be bringing her lunch as well as the Starbucks he brought her earlier. 

Now I don’t hate the guy, she’s been friends for years and he works with us but he’s definitely obsessed with her and if we don’t make this concession every other Sunday it could get bad. Basically I forgot and was already in a bad mood from the arguments and him bringing her Starbucks that I instantly took my lunch and just sat scrolling on my phone instead of eating. After breaks were done she did try to come up to talk and I basically shut it down because I didn’t want to talk and I proceeded to continue to ignore her for the rest of the shift.",i fucked up by ignoring my girlfriend and not communicating with her.,"Girlfriend and I had a misunderstanding, I didn’t tell her until I got to her place and she was confused and upset."

So i asked if her friend was there and she said her friend left somewhere so i said i think that she was cute.

So she says that she doesn’t want to hurt me and i finally give up and go to bed(it was late at night). So the next morning when i wake up i just say good morning and stuff like that. I ask if she is still at her friends and she says yes but doesn’t know when she will leave, and i ask if she wants to play games later, but no answer. And its been like 2 hours so i right a little paragraph saying stuff like im sorry for what i said and did last night and am not pushing anymore. But i didnt get an answer, so i have always blamed myself for things which i know isn’t good but i feel like im responsible. Maybe half an hour to an hour after that i ask if shes still at her friends house and she says no so i ask if she wants to call later. Which she says idk, i ask a couple more little things like when she can go to her dads so we can ply again without an answer. So my big brain asks why she isn’t answering and she said that she is spending time with someone and doesn’t want to talk to anyone.(she only left me on read) and i go like oh my bad and she says she will talk to me with further notice(later). So now i am laying on my bed regretting everything and its put me kinda down, even my parents said i was acting weird. So im writing this on reddit because i want to talk about this unanimously to random people lol. Tomorrow is Monday and this happened over the weekend so it’s the first time we are going to be at school again and im scared.","i ruined my friendship with my girl best friend by saying i liked her and pushing it a little too far, now regretting.

UPDATE 1: So a lot has happened, me and the girl are friends again so we pulled through and its been fun again. Im actually dating a different girl now and its helped me alot. I also want to say thank you for all the help, advice and support.

"TIFU I fell asleep while working from home and missed an important meeting.
I'm very tired lately and sleeping late is the reason. But today I decided to take a nap during my lunch break but I didn't wake up (For people fearing this, yeah, your brain sometimes betray you lol) and missed an important meeting where we were informed about our Managers moving teams and having a new director. From the whole team I was the only one missing, After getting into the call 20 minutes late our manager was still kind to us and that made me feel so bad, like I failed her.  - Hopefully this is the last time this happens to me, such bad timing.

"TIFU and walked away
This actually happened a few days ago. I was sitting at the airport in Atlanta today. A woman was sitting across from me. We kept making eye contact and smiling for a bit. I had to get up and check on something. When I came back she asked me how I was doing. I could barely hear her, so I sat down next to her to talk. After talking for a few minutes, I learned she was not going to the same place I was. Kind of bummed about that. But she was beautiful and easy to talk to. I had to rush away to make my flight and initially left, saying that it was nice to meet her and I hope she had a safe flight home. Immediately after getting on my flight, I regretted not getting her name or number. Been searching the internet to try finding her based on what I know about her. But even if I did find her, I think she'd be creeped out. We don't live near each other, but it's not everyday a beautiful woman seems in to me (I suck at seeing signs, but I'm pretty sure I got these ones correct), (also 90% sure she took a picture of me when I was sitting across from her). We don't live near each other, but still, I felt a connection to her and wish I had just asked for her information. Worst case she would have said no, or we would have realized it wouldn't work.

So if you know (or are) a woman from South Africa, working in Austin, TX as a nanny and had a layover in Atlanta Tuesday, please know I fucked up and I wish I had gotten your information.","I met a beautiful woman at the Airport today, had a good conversation, but fucked up and didn't get her number.",Went to Atlanta airport to talk to a nanny.

"TIFU: remotely trapped a man from FB marketplace over $30
I live in a village of like 15 people and got a large lot of Dell 130W USB-C adapters really cheaply in a liquidation sale. I've had a marketplace listing for a long time and mostly just scammers. I'm not super motivated to sell them on ebay because there is something awesome about having a lifetime supply of solid type c adaptors... I'm keeping them everywhere. I even kept spares in my cars just in case and have given a number to family members. They didn't cost much and they occupy a nice little box on a shelf. 

Fast forward to today's vict^H^H^H^Hbuyer. He's real, he is serious, and he is 45 minutes away, in the nearest city, my wife happens to work in. 

My original plan was to send a new one with my wife to work on Monday... but he negotiated from $40CAD to $30 (100 retail) and thought she has one in her car (but it was recently opened, not new in sealed bag)... Maybe he can get one earlier and get it done now. My wife said it should be okay but had an important executive meeting until 2:00... but 2:45pm seemed safe to add a little buffer. I told him to call her when he arrived and my wife would come to the employee entrance and make the exchange. 
At 2:20pm my wife informed me that the meeting was going to run way over schedule. I passed the information on to the buyer to reschedule.  
Well I guess he didn't see or was a little anxious for a good deal. He arrived and went to the secure employ entrance and an employee on their smoke brake happened to let him in the first set of two doors which require badge in badge out access...

So this poor guy got trapped in a little 10x10 hallway over a stupid power brick... 
And my wife is in an important meeting...
And really the is nothing I could do... being 2 hours in the opposite direction. 

So I regret getting my wife involved to do something for me, sending some rando to her work and being part cause of rando drama of trapping a stranger in a box. 

He eventually got let out of the box. I offered to have her just drop it off at his house but he has since gone non-responsive, I don't have an address and he is about to miss that window of opportunity...",Trapped man. Man escaped. Still have have bait. Wife unimpressed. I'll probably lose a marketplace star rating.,TIFU: remotely trapped a guy from FB marketplace over $30.
"TIFU by taking a huge wiff of ammonia
So basically I recently bought what I THOUGHT was cleaning vinegar. I went to open it earlier today to descale my coffee maker (yay hard water) and noticed a weird, almost soap looking bubble. I thought 'that's odd, never seen that on vinegar' and decided to smell it for some reason. 

Nope. 

Huge, headache inducing, wiff of ammonia. I bought ammonia, which evidently was right next to the vinegar. Apparently I'm illiterate and a moron. Now I can only smell ammonia and have a slight headache. And also a giant ass bottle of ammonia that I have no idea what to do with.

"TIFU by picking the wrong pair of pants.
So today I was suppose to show a kid from the local college around my job as part of our new outreach. 

I dressed up nice and was professional, showed the kid the ropes. Showed him some of my job which involved climbing a ladder at one point. The kid seemed to have a good time and actually ended up staying longer than he was supposed too. 

So I show him out and get back to work. I go to the bathroom and return to my office. I sit down at my desk and feel…a draft. I reach down to adjust and feel something warm and squashy. This startled me and I see some bubble gum between my legs! There was giant tear in my crotch and my nuts were hanging out. 

Embarrassed beyond belief I adjusted my boxers to cover my nuts and shuffled my way out to the parking lot to get my gym pants. I shuffled back into the office. Went to the bathroom and checked the mirror. The tear could be seen from behind. I switched to my gym pants and left the bathroom, only to have the secretary waiting and asking if I was ok. 

I just held up my torn pants and she lost it laughing.

"TIFU by sending a (very) explicit music video to my company's COO
This happened yesterday evening so I haven't gotten any response from the COO; after sending the video link I just immediately messaged ""Oops! sorry about that.""

Background: I have a great boss, I'd say we are good friends. I've smoked blunts with the dude. Conversations between the two of us include profanity, all sorts of jokes, gifs/youtube links, etc. Some things that would not be acceptable in other companies

He sent me a slack message about scheduling our meeting to discuss my raise for the year, and I confirmed the meeting, then I thought it would be funny to send a link to Busta Rhymes' 'Gimme Some Mo', a song which repeats ""even tho we gettin money you should gimme some mo"", constantly features scantily clad women dancing in a suggestive nature, includes countless n-words and other profanity, and generally has a very ""rude"" feel to it. This sort of thing even my boss himself has done in the past. I went to grab a link to the music video, and without realizing it I switched to my direct messages with our COO, where I put the link.

It took me a minute to realize and I just wrote all I could thing of: ""Oops! sorry about that.""

I don't know the COO well, his workday is starting in like an hour, so we'll see how/if he responds.

"TIFU by not checking if the store gave me back the my WHOLE charger
This goes from yesterday into today.

So, for context: I'm a University student, and I need my laptop since all my stuff is on there. A while ago I got the shock if my life when my Laptop stopped charging and wouldnt turn on. Luckily we figured out the issue was the charger, not the laptop, so me, my boyfriend and my mom went to a store whos name I will not name, where we got the laptop from. We still had guarantee.

Now the poor employ had to deal with my mum trying her best to get me a replacement charger for the time being, but they told us they don't have any and that we will have to buy one, and give it back in 28 days, while we still could, and repeat that until the chargers fixed.
Sucks, but fine. 
We go into the store, ask for the charger. They dont have the 15€ charger, only the 40€ other brand one.
I still pay for it and we head home.
The new charger has a faulty connection and cannot charge when my laptops turned on. I deal with this for 26 days.
Fast forward to yesterday, we go in, give the new charger back, and I recieve the old one. I think ""Oh this is really light!"" and dont think to check it. I sign everything.
Today, just 10mins ago, I decided it was time to charge it. 
I get the charger, look at it..
..half of it is missing. I honestly laughed out loud because you wouldnt believe how much shit like this happens to me. I am Gods jester, I play for his amusement, and yet again I am put into dumb situations like these. 
So now I had to call the hotline, and while laughing, explain that ""I only got half the charger, could I maybe have the other half back too?"".

Funnily enough, they only gave me the fucking part that didnt need fixing anyways. 
Will I ever get my damn charger back? I dont know. I'm ordering a cheap brand one off if amazon now and learning from my mistakes and will now cry over the weekend I guess.","I got my charger back from the shop after needing to get it fixed, didnt check if it was the full charger, and ended up only getting one half of the charger.","Went to store, got a faulty charger, got it back 10mins later, had to call the hotline and explain that I only got half the charger."
"TIFU by not eating lunch
so a bit of context, im not diabetic (but i believe i was/am at risk of being pre-diabetic) but my metabolism is naturallyvery fast, and im also on testosterone, which increased it. so if i dont eat something often enough, roughly every 3-4ish hours, my blood sugar will drop (oddly enough this doesn't happen during the night though when im staying up late, just at the normal times im usually awake) so it's not really a (smart) option for me to skip meals.

today i felt lazy. i told myself id make lunch in a bit, but then my mom texted me to ask if id had lunch and without thinking i told her i had. so i couldn't go back on my words now and tell her i lied, so i decided skipping lunch this one time wouldn't hurt. i was wrong.

about a half hour later she and my dad say they're leaving to get eggs. i decide, alright, im hungry, so might as well get toast. my sugar seems to be fine, maybe a little low. (one thing about me, when my sugar drops, i don't get much warning. it starts to seem a little low, and by the time i notice, ive got like 3 minutes before i suddenly feel it really bad). so i make myself some toast with cinnamon and sugar.

as im making it, my sugar drops increasingly faster, so i make some hot chocolate too. eat my toast while i wait for my hot chocolate to cook. by the time it's done, i feel like shit and i know i need a quick snack to get it back up. im drinking my hot chocolate, wandering around trying to find the snacks we literally just bought, panicking.

finally, i find them. by the time i get to my room with an oatmeal creme pie in my hand, im trembling and hot. i finished my hot chocolate and struggle to open the package with scissors. don't ask why i didn't just rip it open like normal, i dont know. by the time ive got it open, my literal open mouth is quivering as i try to put the damn thing in my mouth.

eventually, i eat it and my sugar slowly stabilizes. im okay now, but that whole ordeal was like 20 minutes but felt like 5. so yeah, maybe don't skip lunch if you know it'll have a bad effect on you..",i caused myself to go into a hypoglycemic state because i was too lazy to get lunch,"didn't eat lunch, felt like shit, skipped breakfast, ate oatmeal creme pie, had a bad time."
"TIFU - Nearly gave myself hypoglycemia
If you could tell, I'm not very smart about health stuff. Well- I try to be, but you see where that went. Anyways, earlier yesterday afternoon I'd gotten back from school and I had been kind of constipated, so I decided to take some fiber so I could clear it out. I'm taking these fiber gummies when I notice 'Huh, 3 is a full serving'? So I take one more thinking nothing of it. 

Did I mention I ate literally nothing after this? Past a bag of Cheetos. This was my second FU, loads of fiber and literally nothing on my stomach.

Fast forward to maybe 6 something in the evening, my stomach is beginning to hurt. I realize I hadn't eaten much since I got back, and so I go to grab me a bowl of food. Up to this point I'm okay, just a stomach ache. I head back up and begin to eat when I realize I'm  starting to feel weak out of nowhere. And I'm like ""huh, that's not normal"". I tend to be a hypochondriac, so I thought it was just me worrying or still being hungry. But I can't get over the shakes and weakness, so I go to my grandparents bedroom and tell them about my symptoms. It was then that all of the symptoms hit me full force: shakes, sweating, weakness, fast heart rate. Telltale signs of low blood sugar. My grandma puts the AC on for me, and I try to eat some of my food in hopes it'd alleviate the symptoms, but the weakness deterred me after a few bites. My grandpa noticed this immediately, so he gives me a glucose tablet. I drink some water as well to try and flush it out, but obviously, it would take a minute. I'm still shaking, and basically involuntarily- whenever I even slightly tensed up my whole body would shake, luckily the stomach pain went away a while ago. 

I look up my symptoms and yup, low blood sugar. There's not much for me to do at this point other than lay down and wait it out, so I do just that. There's some points where I do go to the bathroom (fiber emptied my stomach), and the shakes were TERRIBLE, not to mention that my heart's beating like I'd just ran a mile. I'm still weak after the first tablet, so I take another. Then it's just a waiting game after this point; if I was still shaky by 7:30 then I'd go to the doctor. Luckily, the symptoms cleared up. My blood sugar was 120 by then, so I was pretty much fine. 

At least I wasn't constipated anymore, lol.","Constipated so I took a lot of fiber, forgot to eat, tanked my blood sugar and started shaking like crazy. Had to take 2 glucose tablets to even out my sugar","Took fiber, ate nothing, started to feel weak out of nowhere, gave myself hypoglycemia."
"TIFU by unravelling a shawl I'd made
Today I fucked up. I have a skein (ball) of yarn I want to crochet into a scarf. One skein isn't enough yarn. I also have a huge shawl I made when I started learning to crochet, which used about 4 skeins and I never wear. So I decided to unravel it to reuse the yarn bc it was just sitting in my closet all colourful and sad and I don't believe in wasting my crafting supplies.

To unravel a crochet project, you find the end of it and pull while remaking the yarn into a ball. This has about 1000m of yarn. The yarn snagged in many places because it's acrylic and that's what acrylic does.

I was listening to a podcast while unraveling and just... got in the zone I guess. Didn't realise until far too late that I had given myself blisters on both index fingers, and irritations on my thumbs. I didn't even get 20% in. 

Moral of the story: don't get in the zone with material that can give you friction burns. My fingers hurt like hell and my crocheting tonight has been slow and awkward.",Gave myself blisters when unravelling a shawl I made.,"Unravelled a skein of yarn I want to crochet into a scarf, pulled it, gave myself blisters, and irritations on my thumbs."
"TIFU by trying to wash my hair on an empty stomach
Technically, it was *yesterday* that I fucked up. One Redditor asked me in a previous post how I was doing after a recent visit to A&E (ER for my American people). It was comical how I had to tell them shit got *worse*

Btw, I’m 21F and live by myself in a women’s accommodation.

So, I’m on my period. Naturally, blood loss for 7 days = more fatigue, less energy. I know that. I also know that *not eating* for **the whole day** because of nausea can exacerbate those feelings of exhaustion. Nevertheless, my dumb ass got a light bulb of inspiration to wash my hair while my laundry was being done in the washing machine. You know, 2 birds 1 stone all of that.

I wasn’t feeling hungry, so didn’t think it’d be a red flag. Water temp was set to lukewarm, on the colder side. I was wary of steam because I know I’m prone to getting light headed from it. My hair is curly, so of course the detangling and everything else is a process that would’ve taken around an hour in the shower.  About 20 mins in, I get the tell tale signs that I’m about to feel dizzy. I turn off the shower, grab my towel and start drying myself with the intention to take a break & return later. Before I knew what was happening, my vision turns dark and I slam my front tooth and face straight onto the wall infront of me. Hard. 

I try to stumble to my room. Towel is becoming dislodged, my hair is wet and dripping, my breathing rapid. I fumble with the key - but the door’s not opening. I realise I won’t make it. I turn to my flatmate’s door and knock for some assistance. But alas, my vision darkens again, and this time my legs completely give out and I unceremoniously fall onto the dirty ass carpeted hallway with my wet hair and body. I’m out of it for a few minutes, someone runs upstairs and sees me (I’m so sorry girl). She calls the ambulance and helps me get to my room so I can get some clothes on me. The paramedics arrive and take my blood pressure, blood sugar levels and connect me to an ECG. My blood sugar was fine, heart rate was a little fast but due to shock maybe. What worried the paramedics was my BP that was constantly dropping everytime. It went from 102 to 91. They thought it was worth being taken to the hospital.

Anyway, A&E was hell. A lady who claimed she had Sepsis was chasing me & I don’t know why. Too overstimulating, no one that I called was picking up (talk about emergency contacts). My BP was still low at the hospital. They wanted to put a cannula in my arm and give me some fluids to get it back up, and check my red blood cell count. But by this time I had been here for 5 hours, and I just couldn’t anymore.

Signed myself out, took an Uber home and ate, and went to sleep feeling sorry for myself.

Moral of the story: do NOT get in the shower without having eaten the whole day, ESPECIALLY if you’re on your period.

**","** On my period - went to wash my hair without having eaten the whole day, fainted and banged my head and tooth. Embarrassingly naked when someone found me and called the ambulance. Traumatic A&E (ER) visit. Note to self to always eat and take care of myself when I’m losing my monthly blood.",Wash your hair on an empty stomach.
"TIFU by accidentally calling a person old
Not actually today, but this still haunts me… 
I was working in a children’s clothing store, and they were running a big “grandparents appreciation” promotion, where grandparents got 30% off their entire purchase.  The sale was super popular and the store was packed with older folks shopping for grandkids.  We even had lots of moms drag their own parent along, so they could take advantage and refresh their child’s wardrobe, with the grandparent discount .  In fact we didn’t really have any customers that weren’t using the grandparents discount, so as I rang customers up I got into the habit of asking about their grandkids, and most were delighted to tell me all about them and show me pictures.  

You already know where this is going, right? 

This older lady walks up to the counter with an enormous pile of kids clothes (obviously taking advantage of the discount, or so I assumed), with two little kids in tow.  Big customer service smile, and I say  “hi grandma!” She immediately narrows her eyes and says “excuse me?!” 

But my brain is still not engaged, so I stupidly say, “taking advantage of our grandparents day promotion today? Looks like you found some great stuff!” 

She stares me down, and hisses “what are you talking about?!” 

Me, being an absolute moron, doesn’t clue in that I’m clearly pissing this lady off, and instead goes on a ramble about how the grandparents day promotion works and how lucky it is that she’ll get 30% off for being a grandmother. 

She practically spits at me, “I’M THEIR MOTHER.” 

Now, I have no idea how old she was, maybe she just looked old and had old lady style and make-up, maybe she was an older mom, but I swear she looked 60, and the kids looked like 4-6 ish years old.  I still felt like an asshole, and this woman was big mad.  She ended up reporting me to management for my bad customer service, but thankfully they just laughed at my stupidity.

I like to relax by listening to scary stories on YouTube. You know, those deep-voiced narrators talking about skinwalkers in national parks, glitches in the matrix? Good stuff. For months, I paired this with playing Minesweeper to keep my hands busy. It was a nice little routine.

Somewhere along the way, my brain decided that minesweeper is the horror story. Now, when I open the game I get this weird sense of dread.

"TIFU by spending money on porn
One day I followed an 'onlypans' girl on Facebook for dirty jokes and memes and half naked photos.

I comment on her stuff and she replies and sometimes we chat a little in the comments, I decided to hop on her DMs and she happily replied, I was expecting something like"" either you buying or don't waste my time!"" thay made me feel I am talking to a human not a brand which it's lovely.

Months ago by and I am enjoying our little interactions and starting to consider subscribing, but ignore that idea because spending 10-20 dollars on porn is kinda silly besides I have done never that before and I don't want to get sucked in and make it a habbit, time goes by and that idea growing slowly in the back of my mind until I dreamed of her.

Woke up and take it anymore those thirst traps and half nudes aren't helping, she literally made her way into my subconscious and ignoring those thoughts isn't working.

Gosh I feel like the literal definition of a simp, I am not saying she looks bad, she a regular looking human being with regular looking lady parts.","after months chatting with an 'onlypans' girl resisting the idea of buying her nudes I finally caved in, she is very average and I am feeling buyer's remorse.",I paid for subscription and got exactly what I expected.
"TIFU by being too shy to correct my boyfriend and had to change my name
Ten_month_agoIFU actually, sorry Reddit 
 I (20F) never liked my name, so all the social media and game accounts had different nicknames, fictional characters names, etc. About a year before meeting my BF I settled on one nickname and had it everywhere, and even made up a shortened version for games that couldn't fit the whole word. (Imagine the nickname Pumpkin, Pumm for short)

Not really sure what made me use the short version of it as a profile name for a dating app, but I did. And so I matched with this guy, cute, funny, a couple of years older than me , with the only problem being him living in Australia while I'm from a european country. That was the thing we were focusing on - cultural differences and almost opposite lifestyles.

A couple of days later we exchanged numbers and decided to continue talking on insta and that's when he said ""Now I know your real name btw, haha""
I got confused for a second, but then realised - he thought my nickname IS my name.

I'm a pretty shy person, so I couldn't think of a way to correcting him, so I laughed it off and we continued chatting. (TBH I also had doubts it would work out as a relationship bc of the distance, and I thought for a gaming buddy he could become using my nickname as a name would be fine)

Well..it worked out as a LDR and we were planning a meeting (me going to his hometown, since I fell in love with it bc of his stories and pictures and stuff)

That's when I realised my little lie couldn't last any longer, and being half a brain cell I am - instead of admitting I went and legally changed my name to a nickname.

AITA, for context i’m m(18) a guy who is looking for a serious relationship and was addicted to p and was fooling around until half a year ago when i took myself seriously and decided to stop with the mindless sleeping around, i met this girl f(19) who is a very attractive and experienced person, now we were working together and as i started working at the said place she quit like a month later so we got to know each other really good and hit it off.

after a while i realized she wasn’t the person i was looking for and told her that in said words with an explanation why, she tried to push me to meeting with her again and again until i said yes but told her we only go if she gets that it’s not a date and that we’re on the same page.

that night we ended up at my place when we started making out and i realized it’s not worth it and i don’t really want it but still fell for it like a dumbass, key note, i was hesitant the whole night i stopped multiple times and also kept making out to kinda keep the fire alive and when i kept telling her no, i don’t want to proceed but she kept pushing and trying to seduce me of course in a civil way but still not acknowledging she was being rejected until i gave in and we went to sleep.

the next weekend comes along and my poor judgment kicks in and she kept on pushing me to come over and finally i gave up and she came to my place, she tried to make a move and i was hesitant again trying to relieve tension and stop it before it happens which wasn’t successful and after about an hour of mostly saying no, and i emphasize that i did keep the sexual spark alive. 
so i tell her a clear no again and again and she doesn’t wanna back off or put her clothes back on she doesn’t take a no for an answer till i give up after a while and we mostly just make out for a while and when she wants to proceed to serious stuff i sober up say i can’t grab my phone and leave the room.

mind you that before me leaving the room she was pleasuring herself after a couple of minutes with me out of the room she grabs her stuff and rushes to the door crying without saying a word.

the girl is very experienced and clearly doesn’t take a no but i wonder is it truly mostly my fault for even letting temptation get the best of me? 

AITA!?",i got in bed with a woman i don’t desire who didn’t want to take no for an answer so i was mid act and just left the room.,"Dated a girl for a while, fell for her, she tried to seduce me, i gave up, she tries to make out with me again and again until i gave in and we went to sleep, she comes to my place, i give up and she leaves the room crying without saying a word"
"TIFU by stretching
This morning I wake up, I'm laying in bed and as I usually do when I stretch, I tense up and hold it before releasing to relax the muscles. Sometimes I twist, sometimes I don't.

Well, this time something went horribly wrong. I guess I stretched too hard or twisted too far. I feel this burst / pop sensation, and there was instant pain. I am positive it made a noise, but I was too focused on stopping the stretch immediately to really remember.

When I was laying there I was just thinking ""oh fuck"". I could still move okay, but my lower rib area felt tender and swollen. I got up thinking ongoing I will take it easy and assess how it goes throughout the day. 2 hours later and I am feeling the pain pretty bad, and it's spread to my side and lower back. I got my ice pack from the freezer and set myself up in bed with it pressed to me, feeling very sorry for myself.

I ended up napping, did some work online, and overall I was uncomfortable but I could still get stuff done. However, I could tell certain motions are harder to make, and painful. I had to take the garbage bins to the roadside for collection. The bins were not heavy at all, but wheeling them out made it hurt very bad, and now I'm back in bed with ice packs again.

I have a sinking suspicion I may have fractured a rib. By stretching. Stretching!!! Awful start to my day... if it gets any worse I'll be going to the doctor just to know for sure if it's that or if I've popped something out of place or something.",I stretched and I'm now in awful pain and pretty sure I fractured a rib or popped something out of place.,"Stretched too hard, popped a pop sensation, now I have a sinking suspicion I may have fractured a rib."
"TIFU by bombing my dream job interview

This one hurts. I just had an interview for what was, without a doubt, my dream job—an engineering role designing the highest-end racing sailboats and mega yachts. These aren’t just boats; they’re some of the most advanced, high-performance sailing machines on the planet. I’ve been sailing for years and have been on the water my whole life, so getting the chance to work on projects like this would have been everything I could have ever wanted in a career.

On paper, I was a perfect fit. My background, my experience, my skill set—everything lined up exactly with what they were looking for. I went into the interview feeling prepared, confident, and excited. But the second I started talking, it all fell apart.

I don’t know if it was nerves or just pure excitement, but I hated every answer I gave. I wish I had rehearsed some anecdotes and stories more. It’s been a while since I’ve interviewed, and it usually comes naturally to me, but this time, I really didn’t like any of my answers and wish I could redo it.

By the time I walked out of the building, I had a sinking feeling in my gut. I had just blown my shot at the perfect job. Since then, I’ve replayed the entire interview in my head a thousand times, cringing at every mistake and thinking about all the ways I should have answered. There’s not much I can do now, but I’m pretty sure I’m out of the running, and it sucks knowing I lost out on a career that could have made me incredibly happy.","Interviewed for my dream job designing high-end racing sailboats, bombed the interview, and now feel like I lost out on the perfect career.",I bombed my dream job interview and now I’m out of the running.
"TIFU: I Got My FWB Pregnant But I Don't Want To Be With Her.
One of my FWB just came to my apartment and told me that she's pregnant and i'm the father considering that i'm the only guy she's been sleeping with. For months she's been asking me to stop our arrangement and make it an official relationship coz she caught feelings, but i don't love her or any women similar to her. I regret not leaving the moment she broached up that topic and believing that she's still taking her pills everytime we hook up. Not only did she stop taking pills, she also admitted she poked holes in the condom. Honestly i'm planning on asking her to get an abortion because if my parents ever find out, they're most likely force me to marry the bitch since we're of same ethnicity and the kid would be what they always wanted.

 My problem is if ever she doesn't agree to an abortion i'm probably gonna have to abandon her and the baby, pay monthly child support, go back to my home country and hope that she agree to keep it a secret between us. I just have to say it here because i'm not to keen on letting anybody on my personal life know, especially not my parents and i'm too stressed right now that i can barely write this post.

"TIFU by forgetting I has silenced my phone and taking a 4 hour nap
So technically this was yesterday not today. It started with me getting a job interview and my mom realizing that the temperature was in the teens and it had been like 2 weeks since I drove my car. It has a less than 6 month old battery in it but before I got the battery replaced I had on ongoing issue of the car refusing to start when it was cold that I tried getting diagnosed but nobody ever found a reason for. Also, we had a slight chance of ice and a high wind warning.

My car is small and VERY lightweight. It stresses me out to drive it in high winds because it is easily pushed by the wind and it makes it difficult to control. 

So, with all this in mind my mom said if I got up and took her to work I could use her car to go to my interview. Then I would have to go back and pick her up when she got off. No big deal, we've done this several times. My mom goes to work at 7am my interview was at 11am and she was supposed to get off at 8pm (they had a function after work).

First issue. We went to bed about 9pm. I didn't go to sleep though I tried but around 4:30am I gave up because I was exhausted and didn't want to oversleep. My mom has been oversleeping a lot lately and I didn't want to feel rushed taking her to work.

Second issue-I turned the sound off on my phone when I went to the interview. I NEVER do this with this phone because I forget to turn it back on. Usually I just turn the phone completely off. 

Third issue-when I got back home from the interview I had the beginnings of a migraine. I decided to take some pain meds and lay down for like half an hour. I set an alarm on my phone for 7:45pm just in case I actually slept instead of napping because pain meds tend to knock me out. 

About 3:30pm my mom called me to ask me a question. My phone was on silent and I was a sleep so I obviously didn't answer. She figured I was asleep and sent me a text to call her before I came to get her. At 6:45pm they were wrapping up their function and so my mom called to let me know it was almost over. From there until 7:45pm she alternated between calling and texting me.

At 7pm when her event ended and I wasn't there to get her or answering my phone she started asking coworkers if they could give her a ride home. She got home at 7:45 which is when I realized my mistake.

I have another interview today at a different place and the weather is about the same as it was yesterday but my mom has refused to let me drive her car today because I can't be trusted to pick her up. I know it's minor but it really bothered me that I did this. It's not like me to do and I hate having it done to me so it really bothers me that I did it to her. She's also the type that is usually 15minutes early to pick anyone up and gets anxious when I'm even one minute late picking her up even when I let her know I'm on my way.",turned my phone on silent and forgot about it which coupled with other events resulted in my mom not being able to let me know it was time to pick her up.

"TIFU By smoking a preroll and taking a shower
This all started with me going to a smoke shop with my buddies. I was talking to the workers for a good 20 minutes talking about different consumption when I told them I never feel anything anymore and how I most likely need to go on a tolerance break.

They responded to that by telling me what their strongest preroll was so I bought it.

I didn’t smoke weed for a few days because I really wanted this to hit and boy it did. Started hearing sirens (normal occurrence when I’m baked as I get paranoia to the max)

After smoking this alone for a good 6-7 minutes I couldn’t continue I was so high and put it out.

When you get high, what’s the first thing you do? For me, I usually take a shower, very relaxing and calming.

This was not the case this time.

I start taking a shower everything is normal but my music turns off so I step out, put it back in, then continue my shower. This is where it gets nasty.

I start choking. Then I start throwing up. I don’t know what’s happening but I can’t breathe. 

I realize I’m fucking dying for some reason so I get out and start having a full panic attack (induced by drowning)

I tried calling 911 but my hands were too shaky and Siri fucking ignored my ass after I asked to call an ambulance.

I realize I’m butt ass naked and don’t wanna be seen dead without underwear and that’s when I realize I was okay.

I tried convincing myself I was greening out but that’s when I realized I got better, I felt nothing. I would slap my face and feeling nothing pinch myself, also nothing.

"TIFU by not stopping for a dog on the motorway.
Technically this was a few weeks ago. I was driving up the on-ramp for the main motorway in the town I live in. I spotted a dog making their way up there. I am usually a person that will stop for dogs, but I was in an awkward position with cars all around me going 100km/hr that made me hesitate and miss the one spot I could pull over safely. I regretted it the minute I'd done what I did. This was in morning peak-hour traffic, and our motorway doesn't offer many areas to pull over or change course to turn around and go back. I saw later on my community Facebook page that the dog had died with the exact description of the dog and the same stretch of road where I first saw it. I just feel so guilty.

"TIFU by forgetting the word ""dishes""
I might be doomed, I don't think it's possible to come back from this one...



So I returned from work a couple days ago and saw that my partner had done the dishes. I was very happy about this; we both struggle to find motivation to do household chores. 

  
I wanted to thank her for it, positive reinforcement and all! Unfortunately, for some reason my brain refused to produce the word ""dishes."" As I spoke, the words came out as ""thank you for doing the food laundry."" I knew something was wrong, but for some reason I still couldn't process why until she pointed out the madness of what I'd said. I thought it was a one time slip up and carried on with my life.

  
Unfortunately, yesterday, I was filling the dishwasher and informed my partner that I had started the dishes. She responded ""you mean food laundry?""

"TIFU by having a (semi) dirty mouth during a church meeting.
So, I work at a semi large church as their 'kooky catch all fix it gopher'. That's not my actual job title, but it's what I do. Look, they were nice enough to hire a chronically ill agnostic chick, and I show my appreciation by keeping things running.

One of the random things I oversee is our partnership with the Red Cross for bimonthly blood drives. We're one of the biggest drives in the area, so we have regular meetings with a Red Cross organizer.

Our Outreach Ministry is also involved in the blood drives, and they attend the meetings along with me. They're very good 'right kind of Christian people' and they do a lot of good for the community. But they're VERY Christian. 

So, this morning I was on a call with Outreach to discuss the agenda for our upcoming Red Cross meeting. One issue was that there were constant discrepancies between the sign up slots I would take from our account on their website and put on paper sign up sheets, and those which would appear on the Red Cross website in the coming week.

The area I put the sign up sheets out in is called 'The Commons' because it's the big common area between the Sanctuary and event rooms.

Y'all. I kept calling it 'The Condom'. I don't know where my brain was going or why, but every time I tried to say 'commons' it was 'condom'. I say The Commons multiple times a day. I write it. I type it in emails. But nope, today it was 'The Condom'.

A whole lotta awkward silences happened during that call. When I hung up, I wanted to crawl under my desk and die. Yeah, I mix up my speech sometimes, but not Like This!

And I'm aro/ace. I haven't touched a condom since 6th grade when we had to put them on 'Bert' and 'Shrek' (banana and cucumber) in the early 2000s.

But today, I literally could not keep myself from saying the word during an important church call with one of our hardest working ministries.

I was simply just trying to make my self and bowl of weetabix in the morning. I had a stressful day yesterday and was anticipating a stressfully day today. 

So, in my half asleep state I made myself a bowl and grabbed what I thought was the bag of brown sugar to add to my bowl and started mixing. I take a spoonful and immediately feel the grains of rice.

"TIFU by mixing up lab specimens
I'm an intern at this public healthcare set-up where we have to do almost anything and everything ranging from checking vitals, preparing patients to put IV cannulas into veins, draw blood samples and more..

I'm currently posted at this ward where mothers are kept and monitored for a few days after their Ceaserean section. This morning, I had to send samples for routine bloodwork of a few mothers. I was almost done with collecting blood samples when I realised I have mixed up blood samples of the last 4 patients. Prior to work, l always arrange all vials of each patients in seperate rows. The error happened as this morning, I put a few vials of one patient into others' rows. Usually after drawing blood from vein, i always check the labelling of the vial in hand before putting the sample from syringe. Which, as a very bad coincidence, I i didn't do for those last 4 mothers.

The only good thing was that all vials being properly labelled and put back in the same arrangement as previous, it was possible to notice the mistake and seperate those patients quickly.  

I ended up tagging new vials and drawing fresh samples for those four mothers. They were understandably irritated, asking why am I pricking them again etc. I made up some excuse which they believed but I have been feeling very bad myself, for being careless, messing up an relatively easy task, and causing unnecessary pain to my patients.

"TIFU by losing my pasta roller crank
I (29f) was in the mood for some pasta. I usually am, but today it was a strong hankering in particular. 

It's single digits outside and I wanted a rich, creamy, cheesy pasta. 

We didn't have any dried pasta in the cupboard. No problem, I have a pasta roller from Italy. (Christmas gift.)

I got all the materials I needed, thinking I had all the pieces to the roller together. I made a basic egg and flour pasta dough, and set it in the fridge to rest. 

Now the sauce. It was beautiful. 

I melted a sick of butter and tossed in finely chopped garlic, working quickly to toss in flour to make a roux. I then added whole milk to make into a sauce before adding freshly grated Asiago and seasonings. 

The smell. Oh the smell. I immediately felt like I was in an Italian restaurant. I was so proud.

I finished with spinach for freshness.

Now the pasta. 

Oh...no..

I nearly tore apart my kitchen looking for the crank. 

I felt time moving. 

My husband and kids were hungry, my baby was due to wake up for a nursing session any time soon. Dinner was running late!

I quickly grabbed my rolling pin and rolled the dough out as thin as I could make it. Not even remotely close to pasta thin. But it would have to do. 

I cut it into strips.

"TIFU by taking a MacBook to the face
So this just happened, and my nose is still throbbing.

I was lying in bed, MacBook open on my lap, just getting cozy. The lights were still on, so I reached over to turn them off, then leaned back to relax. Big mistake.

My laptop launched itself straight into my face like it had unfinished business. The top edge of the screen made direct, unholy contact with my nose, and I absolutely ate it. Like, full force, zero mercy, straight to the cartilage.

Immediately, blood starts gushing everywheree. My hands are covered, my bedsheets are ruined, and I’m just sitting there in shock, trying to process how my own laptop just tried to assassinate me. The pain was severe, sharp, and throbbing, radiating through my entire face like I had just been smacked by a MacBook-wielding ghost.

After the bleeding finally stopped, I realized things felt off. My nose is swollen and bruised, but worse—I think I now have a deviated septum. Breathing feels weird on one side, and my cartilage is way looser than before. If I move it slightly, it feels unnervingly wobbly, which I’m pretty sure isn’t how noses are supposed to work.

So yeah, I might have broken my nose, or at least messed it up permanently.

"TIFU by mentioning League of Legends and One Direction to my girlfriend.
This happened a couple of weeks ago, but just remembered it again today. Me and my girlfriend play Dungeons and Dragons online on a biweekly schedule. We were grabbing food together at her place before the game started. During dinner, we often converse about our hobby's. Now for added context, my girlfriend has autism. She really loves League of Legends and used to be a really big fan of One Direction back in the day (still kinda is). We also often ask each other fun theoretical questions about our interest: ""What would you do if X"", ""How would you want to change Y"" etc. 

So, I asked her: ""If league of legends made a new boyband, and the members were voiced by the original members of One Direction, who would each member voice?"" Little did I know what I had just done. My girlfriend, clearly intrigued by the question instantly started to be sunk into thought. She started listening to the solo's of each 1D member and asked for my phone so she could have a picture of league of legends characters next to it open. She took this very seriously. I mentioned that we should probably hurry up a bit, as the DnD session was about to begin and we both still had to set up for it. She didn't listen however.

"TIFU by not reading all the instructions on Nair
So.... I ordered sensative skin nair for my nethers, so I wouldn't have to deal with razor burn. I got it to try instead of going from razor to wax. Got in the shower, read the first couple lines of how to and proceeded to apply. In 3 batches. On my groin... I'm a man. I didn't keep it on more than 1p minutes at a time.... or so I thought. I evidently did not rinse enough in between treatments because now my scrotum is nice and firery right at the top. Basically the worst place to burn (granted, there ***isn't*** and ""good"" place for it to burn, but if it had to pick the worst, it's where the scrotum meets the base). Thank God I had silvadene on hand. But multiple treatments in and it still looks almost as bad as it did yesterday. It wasn't until it really started to burn that I read the full instructions and warnings..  like the one about not using it on genitals. (In my defense, it was **sensitive skin** Nair)",I fd up by not applying nair as directed. On my scrotum.,TIFU by not reading the instructions on Nair.
"TIFU by not wearing my glasses
Tw: (sewing) needles.

So today, dear reader, I have been wandering around my apartment without my glasses because I'm down with bronchitis and alternating between bed and shower. It's not a long walk! Maybe ten steps! What could go wrong?

Well, dear reader, I quickly figured out what COULD go wrong on my way back to bed when I suddenly felt a stinging pain in my foot and yelped. I looked down and DEFINITELY didn't put weight on the offended foot - and found that I had a pin cushion stuck to the bottom of it.

You might wonder why it was on the floor upside down. I think the reason is a certain young tuxedo cat who frequents my crafting desk and doesn't watch what she knocks over, and likely accidentally pushed it off. She never messes with it on purpose.

Anyway, because my vision is a kind of a cloudy soup when I am not wearing my glasses and because I wasn't paying attention to the floor, I now had to yank an entire pin cushion from my foot skin. I was lucky in that my feet have thick soles so I didn't bleed more than a couple of drops, and in that I hadn't stepped on the cushion with the middle bit of the foot where the skin is thinner -- but I still had to spend a couple of minutes sitting on the edge of my bed with this thing pinned to my foot and ponder my life and whether or not this, if not the bronchitis, would force me to go to the hospital after all. And if so, how one puts on pants when their foot has a new attachment like this. (It didn't.)

But hey, it did help me forget that my throat was sore for like fifteen minutes! Can't really recommend as pain relief though. While it didn't bleed, you still end up with a bunch of pinpricks on the bottom of your foot that make walking a Less Than Pleasant experience.",walked through my apartment without my glasses and got a pin cushion stuck to the bottom of my foot as a result.,Pinch cushion stuck to the bottom of my foot caused me to spend a couple of minutes sitting on the edge of my bed with it stuck to my foot.
"TIFU by assuming nothing was happening
TIFU. So, I got a new phone for Christmas and I didn't realise that it had a battery saving feature where it decided to mute app notifications if it decided the app was using the battery too much. 

I've missed so messages, appointments, things I had in my calendar. I don't have any close friends or anything so it wasn't unusual to not get messages or things like that, and some of the twitch/YouTube channels I follow have a break after the holidays so I just assumed they hadn't done anything.

I also thought it was just glitchy when I went onto the calendar app and noticed I'd missed an appointment. Never occurred to me it was my phone conspiring against me. It even muted the system notifications telling me it was saving the battery.

"TIFU with accidental Islamophobia
My work does a donation program where several different charitable organizations pick up from us. Recently we've been trying to get more organized about which of the smaller orgs pick up what on which days, since they generally don't introduce themselves anymore (this program has been in place for a long time). One of the orgs is a group we just refer to as ""The Terraces"".

 An older, vaguely Middle-Eastern looking guy came in and told me he was here to pick up. I asked which organization he was from, and he gave me a kind of non-answer, which I assumed was due to a language barrier, as he had a very heavy accent and somewhat broken English. I was halfway certain that this was one of The Terraces' pickup days, so I asked him ""Are you from the The Terraces"". He instantly looked a bit startled and offended, and replied ""No! I am Israeli!"". I corrected, and said ""No, no, *which organization are you from*?"". He understood what I was saying that time, and gave me the name of his org (*not* The Terraces), and then went about picking up the donation, but clearly was not happy with me.

 It took a few minutes for me to realize what had happened. This guy 100% thought I had asked him ""Are you from the terrorists?"" and now thinks I am either a bigot who assumes all Middle-Eastern people are terrorists, or was being rabidly anti-Israel.

"TIFU by misunderstanding my gynecologist
This actually happened on Thursday, but my soul has only just now come back to my body.

I visited the gynecologist on Thursday for my yearly exam. I see a male gynecologist, and while he’s a little awkward, he’s a very nice guy, a good doctor, and hasn’t given me “creep” vibes. 

Before he came in, I took off everything except my socks and put on the little gown they gave me. I settled on the bed and then he entered. 

We make a little bit of small talk just so we’re not in silence, go through the “any concerns, anything you need to bring up since last visit etc” and then it’s time for the old peek. I put my legs in the stirrups and he begins his exam. 

He must be feeling awkward from the silence, because after a minute, he says “oh, you must have a cat, huh?” I do have a couple of cats, but I hadn’t mentioned that to him. 

My brain short-circuits. How can he tell I have cats just from looking at my vagina? Does it smell like cats down there?! So I say “why?? does my vagina smell?” 

He must have interpreted my question as “why does my vagina smell?” And he said “I’m not smelling anything right now, can you describe the smell?”

My brain goes into overdrive. What the fuck does he mean can I describe it? He’s the one down there?? So I clarify “can I describe the cat-vagina smell??” 

He pauses and sits up straight and just says “what?” 

And so I say, “do I smell like cats down there? How could you tell I have cats?”

His face turns bright red and he points to my foot in the stirrup, or more specifically the cat socks I’m wearing, which also happen to have a single white cat hair clinging to the sock. 

I said “oh. I thought my vagina smelled like cats or something.” 

He shook his head and he very quickly finished up.

So my vagina doesn’t smell like cat,  but I don’t think I can go back to him.",I thought my gynecologist could smell my cats on my pussy.,I thought my vagina smelled like cats.
"TIFU by telling a customer they only want to hear themselves talk
Obligatory, this was not today but a couple of weeks ago. 

I (F) am a supervisor on the phones in a predominantly male driven industry; when the going gets tough I’m usually the one hopping on to de-escalate an unhappy customer.

There are only a few women in my company and one of them is also on the phones alongside me (we’ll call her A). “A” is a sales rep while I am the only female in a position of power and the only supervisor on call 5 days of the week. So naturally, I tend to the unhappiest of customers. 

“A” passed along a request for a supervisor from customer “J”; she relayed his condescension, mentioning that he wanted to “speak to someone who actually knows what they’re talking about” and “not just reading off a script”. 

Now, “A” may not understand all the technical reasonings behind what she says, but she is damn good at her job and has been dealing in the same industry for well over 3 years. She knows that what she is saying is fact, not opinion, and knows that she can stand firm in the policies she is relaying. Also, she has personally seen from experience people go against policy and get burned meaning she has first hand experience. I state all this for a reason: the customer had paid for ‘training’ in our field but was belittling “A” for not truly understanding what she was saying. 

I hop on with this customer and admit, I didn’t enter the chat with honey dew in my voice. However, I allowed “J” time to explain the situation to me as I do for every customer; I always listen to previous phone recordings so I’m well aware of what both parties said. Once he’s relayed his half truths and thrown out the fact that he’s ‘trained’ in this industry, I begin to explain to him the mechanics behind the policy he has paid for. 

Only to find that I was actually never speaking, “J” had never left the chat. He begins to speak over me every time I begin a new sentence. Just talks AT me, through me, around me, over me, but never with me. If I begin a rebuttal, he quickly cuts me off to explain how my not yet completed thought is wrong. If I try to bring up a question or analogy to better help him understand, he simply raises his voice and repeats over and over the same idiotic thought he has already said. 

Now, I’ve dealt with idiots before. I’ve dealt with arrogance, rudeness, shortness, but I have never in almost a decade of working in this industry had someone speak as condescendingly arrogant as “J” did. Mind you, the training he went through ANY IDIOT can pay for, and the training only speaks on a certain field of work (which we do NOT operate in, but which we have passing interactions with). His argument that he’s ‘trained’ would be like me saying I understand how to train dogs when I’ve paid for an online class. It is in no way comparable to real life experience. 

So as this man is raising his voice at me, speaking in high pitched tones and throwing out the same words over and over like a toddler, my almost decades long customer service hat flies right out the window and I hear myself say, “can I finish my thought or do you just want to hear yourself talk?”

Not my proudest moment, but it did get “J” to shut up long enough for me to finish my sentence! I went as low in my offer as my policy allows me to, but “J” wanted us to come out for free and repair the issue he made. I ended up having to hang up because every time I’d try to get a final word in he’d just start back up repeating the same question over and over. “Are you going to come out and do XYZ?”.

He threatened legal action and left us a bad review. Not worried, we have an almost perfect rating and legally speaking we are bulletproof, but now MY boss is going back to listen to the calls. Can’t help but worry that this could reflect negatively on me, since I am expected to hold my “emotions” in place as one of the few women in my field. 

I know we’re supposed to grin and bear it in the customer service field, but there’s nothing worse than someone talking down to you when you could walk circles around them in a stand off. Definitely feeling regretful that this is the call my bosses will most know me for. 

TL; DR TIFU, the only way I could get a rude customer to stop talking was by calling them out for not shutting up; now the call is under review with my boss.",,TIFU by telling a customer they only want to hear themselves talk.

"TIFU by forgetting that Reddit is only as anonymous as you make it (and blowing up my relationship with my family over it)
Obligatory this-isnt-technically-today. Really this is more like ""I've been kinda dumb for like ten years"" but hey. Buckle in, it's a long one. 

My childhood was exceptionally isolated. When I was about five years old, we moved to the top of a mountain in the middle of the desert, ostensibly because my parents wanted their eventual eleven children to grow up free and wild, but also because extremely traditional Catholicism tends to stick for children when those children have absolutely no contact with reality. We would descend the mountain for church on Sundays, and then once a month we would join other Catholic homeschoolers for a morning at a local park, and some years we did 4H, but that was about the extent of my socialization. I was unhappy, but I was never quite sure why (and my parents were always very quick to explain that my unhappiness was a result of the devil or spiritual attack). 

Enter the internet. 

The glorious, populated, community-filled internet. 

As an older teen I began doing some classes online and I got an ancient brick of a laptop to help with that. And naturally, I eventually found reddit. Finally I had found a place where I could have community with other people and nobody would ever have to know I was an awkward homeschooler with a terrible long skirt and an awful haircut. I started in the Catholicism subreddit, and tended to keep it open in one page in case my parents walked in, but then in another page I could explore. And oh, the freedom of exploration. I learned history and science. I joined fandoms and discovered podcasters. I learned interesting terms like ""bisexual"" and even saw pornography for the first time. And I talked. To other people. People who weren't homeschooled or sheltered or even Catholic. 

Not going to lie, I said some bullshit. For the first solid, oh, six years that I was here, I was drinking that Catholic kool-aid hard. If you look far enough back at my history, you'll find a homophobic, transphobic religious bigot. Honestly, hella cringe. I also had a habit of occasionally complaining about the things my family did, especially as I began to realize just how desperately abnormal and unhealthy my childhood was. Word to the wise, kids, don't post your family drama on your main. It will eventually come back to bite you in the ass. 

Eventually, with time and love and joining the real world, I grew out of the cringe. I left the Catholic Church once I finally realized the depths of its misogyny, racism, and corruption. I realized that the fun word ""bisexual"" described me and started meeting with other queer people, and found out that they were not depraved predators, but honestly the warmest and most lovely bunch of people I'd met. I learned the real truth behind all the ""pro-life"" things I had been taught. I read books about abortion and trans rights. I connected with people in my town and then started doing IRL things once Covid ended, and now I volunteer at my library every week. I realized that I'm not broken and disgusting, waiting to be saved by an angry god. I made real friends and really learned to love myself for the first time. 

But you've been waiting for the fuckup. 

I made the catastrophic mistake of posting a picture of my sister's wedding on reddit. 

You'd think that was nothing. I thought that was nothing. But my sister's ex, who has been involved in a decade-long custody battle with her, did not think it was nothing. In fact, he somehow managed to find the post and then from there find my reddit account. And boom. Ten years of content. Homeboy must have read through thousands of posts and comments. And he found the ones where I complain about my childhood, commiserate with people about how my family is still conservative when I've gone to the liberal dark side, weird poems about fights with my sister that I wrote at 18. He went through posts about my struggles with fertility and struggles with religion. And he entered screenshots of them into evidence as proof that my family was not fit to be around the kid.  

By the time I had been told what had happened, told to delete posts, it was too late. My dad had the screenshots and then he went and found more. My whole family saw them. My grandparents called and texted in horror. My aunt across the country was dragged into it. The next thing I knew, I had text after text from my sister telling me that I needed to make a statement that I was a psychotic lunatic, lying about all of it. My mother apparently wrote a statement for me that said as much, according to another sibling that saw it before she tried to make me sign it. My sister claimed that wouldn't get custody of her kid back if I didn't either claim psychosis or sign a statement to that effect. Because that's perjury, though, I did not. Because see, I'm not a lunatic. I'm a dumbass who overshares on Reddit (who isn't?) and I've been diagnosed with depression (who hasn't?) but psychotic? No. 

I wrote my own statement, basically laying out all of what I just said. I was a sheltered kid who used the internet badly, and some of what I had said online has been said without the full knowledge of their respective situations, but my mistakes were my own. And because my sister had been adamant that I needed to call myself psychotic, and my mother had already written something for me, I thought it best to send to my sister's lawyer directly, so that nothing could be added or amended without my knowledge.  

This was, apparently, a Big Mistake. I woke up to an email from my sister about how she can't believe I would imply I don't trust her (would you?) and how I'm going to die alone without any friends or family. She's going to paint me in court as psycho anyway because only a crazy person would (checks notes) talk to a lawyer in a legal situation instead of the person who already seems to have made plans to have you perjure yourself. My whole family basically hates me and that's the end of that. 

All in all, you might agree, no great loss. And it's not. No, friends, the loss is this reddit account. Ten years of karma. Ten years of relationships and carefully curated content. I shall have to start again with a new account, hopefully much more anonymous this time around. I'm torn between never touching this account again and using it as my new account exclusively for writing r/erotica content, since now I know my father will be looking on at all my posts in disapproval anyway. Might as well lean into it. 

I'd say I'll catch you all on the flip side, but I really hope I'm not caught anywhere. I am so ready to go back being just another anonymous face in the reddit crowd and this time I plan to stay that way.","I used Reddit like a personal diary for a decade, and much like what happened with my actual diary when I was ten, my family found it and it's basically destroyed our relationships.",My childhood was a hell of a lot better than I thought it would be.

My cat died yesterday. She was my baby and I miss her very much and I can barely function without randomly bursting into tears. I took off work yesterday so I could grieve and bury jer in my in my yard under the bench we used to sit on and watch the birds in the summers.  I thought she'd like that.   My sister stopped by to console me and brought me a homemade meal. Despite it being delicious I could barely eat and saved it for later.  Today I had to go to work so I packed the rest of the dinner for lunch. When I came in my eyes were puffy from crying and people were asking me what happened and I explained about my cat.  During lunch I was heating up my food and and a woman I work with asked me what I was having and I responded with ""the remains from yesterday"".  She looked disgusted but I thought whatever maybe she doesn't like to eat food from a previous day.  A few hours later I got called into HR and was told my colleagues would prefer I didn't eat house pets in the shared dining space.  Wtf?  I was so confused, then appalled, why would anyone think that???  I was going back to all the conversations I had that day and at no point did I say anything about eating pets.  HR lady let me go but then a few hours later caled both me and the women who watched me heat up my lunch in.  That's when it came out I said I was heating up ""remains"" when I meant ""left-overs"" and my coworker assumed that meant I cooked my cat and was eating it due to some mental breakdown I was having.

"TIFU: When My Snoring Became the Star of the Show at Our Class Retreat
Our class retreat was supposed to be a fun break, but I had no idea that the most memorable part would come from something *I* did—snoring.

It all started when we arrived at the retreat, after hours of travel. I was completely exhausted, and after the group briefing, I decided to take a quick nap. I thought I was being discreet, but apparently, I wasn’t. I fell asleep and snored *so loudly* that it echoed across the room. Everyone, including my crush, heard it and started laughing.

I woke up to my friend nudging me, telling me everyone was laughing at me. I was confused until I realized why: My loud snoring had become the highlight of the event. I tried to laugh it off, but when I saw my crush laughing too, I felt mortified.

To make matters worse, the teacher joked, “Looks like we’ve found the new alarm clock!” and the room erupted in laughter. I was dying inside, wishing I could disappear.

But as the retreat continued, my friends made me feel better. They reassured me it wasn’t a big deal and joked that I had the loudest snore they’d ever heard. While I still felt embarrassed, I realized it wasn’t the end of the world.

By the end of the weekend, the snoring incident had become a funny memory, and though I was still unsure how my crush saw me, I learned that it was okay to laugh at myself. Sometimes, even the most embarrassing moments can bring people closer together.","During a class retreat, I accidentally snored loudly while taking a nap, causing everyone, including my crush, to laugh at me.

"TIFU by being the reason my close-friends broke up.
Hello Reddit. If anyone has advice, I would greatly appreciate it. 

My friend (T 21m) and his girlfriend (A 22f) are no longer together. A lot of it is because of me. Here’s what happened. 

A and T were some of the first not-from-home friends I made at college. I met A met during parents weekend at a massive football game get together (we went to a big football school, game days were a big deal). We hit it off and clicked. 

Well, the next day her and I matched on tinder. A week or so later, her and T got together. During the course of her and T’s relationship (over a year) she would always tell me she met me before she met T. More on that later. 

T asked me when her and A started becoming a thing if there was anything he needed to know about the tinder match thing, and I told him the truth. I told him there was nothing between her and I. I truly didn’t have feelings for her, she didn’t have feelings for me. 

Fast forward about a year later, and A starts pulling me aside at group hangouts (parties, the bar, etc.) and would tell me things I had no right knowing about their relationship. Why they’re fighting, what she’s thinking, he makes her cry, things like that. T is very involved with the Andrew Tates of the world so knowing that, I kinda assumed that T was being the bad guy. It also felt like A was coming to me as a “damsel in distress” type, but she would only bring this up to me after her and I were drunk. And I do have a predisposition towards women, so wrongfully I believed her and never said anything to T. 

This became a slippery slope. One night, on a weekend while T was out of town, she asked if I wanted to go bar hopping and I said sure. I like to have a good time, and all the places are heavily trafficked so I didn’t think anything of it. I told her I agreed, and she told me “we can pregame at my place, and you can help pick my outfit”. I thought this was weird, but wrongfully again I played along. 

In picking her outfit, she said (and I’m quoting directly), “my shorts and jeans are here, my shirts are here, and my slutty tops are here” and then she went back to doing makeup. 

It was a hot summer evening so I picked out Jean shorts and a normal t shirt. I did NOT choose a slutty top, I want to make that clear. 

Well we get to the last bar of the trip, and she is being overly flirtatious with me. She told me that she pointed out where her slutty tops were on purpose hoping I would pick one because “T never lets me wear anything like that”. She also wanted me to place my hand on her thigh, and would kind of grind her ass on me while playing pong. I asked her “are you sure this is ok?” She said “I’ve known you longer than I’ve known T. If anything makes me uncomfortable, I will always tell you first if there’s a problem with us”. 

When we left, we went to a mutual’s house and he immediately went to bed which left A and I alone on the living room couch. She practically sat on my lap, and I was really drunk and I kissed her on the cheek. She gave me a sign like I should keep going, so I kissed her neck as well. No clothes were shed, and lips never touched. 

We never really spoke of that night. Fast forward almost 3-4 months and her and T are still together. T goes out of town, and we go bar hopping again. We get to the last bar of the trip, and we sit down on barstools near the dance floor and again, she’s wanting me to put my hand on her thigh. She also sees guys she knows at the bar that she is NOT dating, and says “I kinda want to go dance with those guys, but I don’t know if I should. Will you tell?” I shrugged and didn’t say anything, and off she goes. After she’s done dancing, she’s hanging out with that entire group of guys. I am left alone for over an hour. I message her and say “I came here to have a good time, not to be left alone. I’m going to another bar”. I walk to another bar about a mile away. As soon as I get there T calls me and says “you wanna tell me what happened tonight?” I said “what do you mean?” He says “A said you made her really uncomfortable”. I then told him what was going on and the guys she was dancing with and everything. The rest of the night I don’t really remember. I think T called me again after 30-45 minutes, but I don’t remember the content of the conversation. 

T and I talked again in the morning after and I told him “I apologize, I kept stuff from you and I shouldn’t have, and that was wrong. I admit that, it was shitty, but I hope you know the last thing I’m gonna do is lie to you”. 

Apparently A was telling T that she never danced with anyone at the last bar. Her story is I forcefully grabbed her, she fought back against me, and I left the bar. 

T told me if I could help him prove anything of what we were saying that would be appreciated. I told him I don’t know if anyone can prove what we’re saying, I can just tell you what I know happened. 

A few weeks later, A was back on my tinder and they were no longer together. 

P.S. There’s a lot more detail I could go into about our conversations when she’d pull me aside, but I wasn’t sure how much space I had. I feel very bad for T. He didn’t deserve this from her, or especially me. I feel like I was someone he could trust and respect and I completely let him down. We’ve seen each other a few times since all this, and he never makes eye-contact or speaks to me. Which is more than fair. Ideally, I’d love to make things right and be friends, but I don’t think that’s possible.","I was roped into situations with my close friend’s girlfriend that I didn’t know how to handle, so I did the worst things possible. She lied to him and me, and he ended their relationship.",My friend and his girlfriend broke up because of me. I don’t know what to do.
"TIFU: When I Ordered Fast Food on Foot Like a Drive-Thru Pro
So, last weekend, I definitely had a little too much fun with my friends. We were out drinking, laughing, and just enjoying the night, when we stumbled across a fast food drive-thru on our walk home. Now, here’s where things get funny— and slightly embarrassing.

I was so tipsy that I just *had* to place an order. So, without thinking, I walked up to the speaker, leaned in like I was in a car, and casually said, “Beep beep! I’ll have a large fries, please.” The person on the other end was dead silent for a second, clearly trying to process what just happened. I looked around and realized, oh wait—I was walking, not driving!

I didn’t back down though. I just stood there, confidently waiting for my fries. I heard the worker laughing in the background before they handed me the order through the window. I think they were so confused but too polite to question me.

When I walked away, I was cracking up at myself, but seriously, I could’ve sworn I was in a car! Definitely learned my lesson: next time, I’ll skip the drive-thru when I’m drunk and just stick to ordering online.","After a night of drinking, I drunkenly walked up to a drive-thru speaker, ordered food like I was in a car, and even did a ""beep beep"" for effect.

"TIFU By Misreading A Recipe
So this happened several years ago, but it's one I love to share, and thought it'd at least make a few people laugh.

I was in my early 20's, and my family had only recently discovered cooking shows. Food Network, Gordon Ramsay, Iron Chef, etc. We were inspired to expand our cooking abilities beyond the handful of recipes we'd all stuck to up until that point. This particular day, I decided I wanted to try making my own fried rice. I'd like to apologize in advance to Uncle Roger, if he ever sees this.

The recipe I decided to use was supposed to be pretty simple. But I somehow managed to misread the first, vital ingredient. It called for ""8 Cups Cooked Rice"". Somehow my brain translated that as ""COOK 8 Cups of Rice"". I had never cooked rice from scratch before. The best I'd ever done was Minute/Instant rice, which doesn't expand much. I was not prepared for the horror about to happen.

I started off in one of our smaller pots, like I would for instant rice, but before too long, the rice was about to overflow, so we poured it into a bigger pot and added more water. Then it happened again. And again. Before we knew it, we had poured this nightmare of a cooking fail into our largest stock pot, STILL trying to rescue this. We abhor food waste, and were desperate to avoid having to throw away so much food.

But that's not where the fuck up truly ends. Because we were trying so hard to rescue this rice, we just kept stirring. By the end it was like trying to stir half-dried concrete. At one point, I pulled back on the spoon and felt a loud ***pop*** in my wrist. I stopped stirring instantly, got some ice on it, and had to stand off to the side as my parents finally decided there was absolutely no way to rescue this disaster, and dumped the pot out.

I wasn't able to get to the doctor immediately (If you live in the US, you'll understand), so we weren't 100% sure what happened to my wrist. Mom is a nurse, so we tried treating it as best we could, and I wore an off the shelf wrist brace for a while. I was finally able to get to the doctor, and discovered that *I'd sprained my wrist*. *STIRRING RICE.* 

By the time I was able to get into physical therapy, my injured hand measured at half the strength of my uninjured hand. Which is bad enough, but it was my DOMINANT hand, so I was severely limited in everything. It took a while, but I got the strength and dexterity in my hand up to equal the other one. My wrist still pops on occasion when I rotate it in just the right/wrong way, and hurts if I sleep on it at a bad angle. All because I couldn't cook rice. And no, I've never tried to cook rice from scratch again.",I was so bad at cooking rice that I sprained my wrist trying to stir it.,I misread a recipe and sprained my wrist.
"TIFU by accidentally confessing… to the wrong person
So this happened today, and I want to disappear.

I’ve had a crush on this girl for months. We text a lot, joke around, and sometimes she might flirt back, but I’ve never been sure. After overthinking for weeks, I finally decided to confess.

I typed a heartfelt message, something like:

""I don’t know when it happened, but you’ve become really special to me. I like you a lot, and even if you don’t feel the same, I just wanted you to know.""

I stared at my phone for 10 minutes, hesitated, and finally sent it. Then I threw my phone across the bed like it was cursed.

A minute later, my phone buzzed. I grabbed it, full of nerves—AND THEN I SAW IT.

I SENT IT TO THE WRONG PERSON.

Not my crush. Nope. I sent it to my friend. My male friend. The one who knows all my dumbest moments. The one who has seen me fail at life in real-time.

And his response?

""Bro… same.""

WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?! 😭💀

Now I’m just lying here, questioning all my life choices. Send help.

"TIFU by almost getting my ass stung mid-shit
So, after two days of not going (small appetite and I was studying for exams), I finally sat down for some much-needed relief. But fate had other plans.  

I’m mid-shit, when I hear buzzing outside the window panes. I think, okay, probably a bee, and since I’m terrified of bees, I brace myself. But then,THE THING COMES INSIDE! 

Panic. Sheer, primal panic. I literally stand up mid-shit, pants half-down, in absolute fight-or-flight mode. The bee starts zooming around like it owns the place, and before I can process my life choices, it FALLS INTO THE TOILET.   

Now, I flush. Once. Twice. It’s still there. Refusing to leave. And I’m just standing there, clenching, thinking, shit go away I wanna shit. 

Desperate times call for desperate measures. I grab the nearest thing the phenol floor cleaner,and pour it into the bowl. The bee finally meets its end. Another flush. Gone.  

And THEN, I shitted. So. Damn. Fast. After two days of buildup, my body was like evacuate IMMEDIATELY before another boss fight starts. 

But the real horror? The whole time, I was TERRIFIED it would sting my ass. Imagine explaining that to a doctor. ""Yeah, so I was mid-shit when a bee committed a home invasion and stung me."" I'd have to get a new ass. Move houses. Change my name. Start a new life.

"TIFU by passing gas at my desk on valentines day
Thismorning started off lovely. Me and my boyfriend had coffee together with some V day fun. After he left my stomach felt off, but I figured it was just my stomach settling from the excitement of being with him. 

Driving to work my stomach gets progressively more unsettled. It feels like my gut is bubbling and moving fast. I get to the office before any of my coworkers and start to settle into my desk. I start typing my first email and I pass a little gas. But one felt warmer than the others. And i instantly get scared that it might've been more than gas. As soon as i start to stand up, my coworker walks in and says ""Wow smells like a barnes and nobles in here!"" 

I'm both mortified but also dying laughing on the inside. I say ""Really!?! Smells like books or something?""

And he says ""Yeah books and coffee its a great smell""

I laugh a little and say ""Those are great smells!""

I make my way to the bathroom and confirm my horror that i did in fact pass more than just gas. I find an excuse to leave the office and run to the nearest target to get new underwear. But all day, all i can think about is how my co worker thought my chocolate surprise smelled like barnes and nobles bookstore.

For a while we had a friend group chat that all met through the website and we would video call etc. after being friends with a for a few months he really wanted to be in a relationship with me.

Once she dropped him off at my house I introduced myself to his mom real quick and she drove off. We got an Uber to target because I didn't have my license yet, we got a box of condoms and a Plan B.

Not only did my virginity get interrupted but my ex got blue balled. 

We broke up a couple months later because he started getting extremely controlling about anyone I would talk to if they were a male and I'm not about that shit.

"TIFU by confessing I may have accidentally given a handjob to a 60 year old
TIFU by confessing I may have accidentally given a handjob to a 60 year old

So, some context: A year ago, I was working as a clinical assistant (CA) in a hospital, which required me to help doctors with their work. Mostly, it was translating (for patients who didn’t speak English), but sometimes, I had to assist with simple procedures.

So, I (19/M) was dealing with some lab reports as usual when I got a call from my manager asking me to come to her office. When I got there, she asked if I could go to the scan room (where the hospital provides ultrasound services) to assist the doctor. This was a strange request because, in my hospital, only female CAs were allowed in that room. But since I was eager to be part of any procedure I could, (male CAs didn’t get many opportunities out of respect for female patients), I immediately accepted before she could even explain what I was supposed to do.

I went to the scan room, and there was a male patient lying down with no pants on, which didn’t really bother me. I had worked a lot in the urology department and had seen my fair share of pencils. Apparently, my job was to hold his dipstick while the doctor performed the scan because she didn’t want to touch it. 💀

I mentally prepared myself, gloved up, and held his pizzle, but what I didn’t anticipate was the sheer amount of gel, which made it ridiculously slippery. While she was probing it, I was struggling to keep his propagator upright. I was supposed to hold the head of the python, but it kept slipping away, so I had to keep readjusting my grip—which, in hindsight, may have felt like a handjob for the patient.

Anyway, I forgot about it because, well, it’s a hospital—there’s always something weird going on.

Fast forward a year later: I was no longer working at that hospital, and I was chatting with some people who worked as CAs in a different hospital. I decided to share some of my wisdom and experiences with them so they’d be prepared for all the weird shit they might see. (No patient-identifying details were shared because that would be an absolutely shitty thing to do, not to mention totally illegal and unethical.)

I told them about some of the things I had encountered—things that might be shocking to people outside the medical field. Then, I mentioned the time I had to prop up a beanstalk for 10 minutes. And that’s when all hell broke loose.

I got absolutely wrecked in the group chat. People were calling me out for ""giving a handjob to a 60-year-old"" and flaming me for a solid half-hour. At that point, I regretted telling them about it in the first place. I was also given the nickname “The Snake Handler”.","While working as a clinical assistant, I was asked to assist with an ultrasound by holding an older male patient's ahem equipment because the doctor didn’t want to touch it.

"TIFU breaking into my own house early in the morning to store a bunch of cash.
I stayed out of state for a month, working for a guy for cash. When I was done and finally made the LONG drive home, I got back at 3am. I had been up for roughly 30 hours, and I immediately went to bed.

A couple of hours later I get a call from the guy that sent me for the work, he had already had my hours tracked and agreed to on my drive home, but he called early ready to give me money. I thought I was dreaming cuz like dude I just got back? But no, he was like “no I’m paying you.” I wasn’t going to argue, so I got dressed and went downstairs to invite him in quick. 

Well he was in his vehicle so I was like “man, I gotta go out in the snow.” So I put on some light shoes and went outside and shut the door behind me, immediately realizing I didn’t twist the handle all the way when I opened my door (it won’t unlock the handle’s lock if you don’t fully twist it) 

Well now he gets out and we meet halfway between my locked door and his vehicle and he hands me the type of amount of money that won’t  let you go back to sleep if you tried, you know? But I’m locked out and too embarrassed to say anything about it. So I’m in the snow, trying to

Well the police showed up after 15 minutes. It was easy to prove I lived there, and the one (definitely cooler) cop was laughing and said he never found someone breaking IN to a house with a large amount of money. They helped me get in through my sliding glass door, which reminded me to immediately deposit the cash when my bank opened, because holy shit it was easy for them to open that.

"TIFU by using an ab roller
This happened two days ago and I'm posting this in the hope that this could help someone else from fucking up. I have been going to the gym for almost a year now and been enjoying the process very much. I know people usually complain a lot about shoulder pain or other such injuries but I thought I was lucky in that regard. Till now. Recently, I decided that I need to improve my core strength more as I have been skipping ab workouts and felt that I might be lagging in this group compared to other muscles. I usually stick to the crunches and leg raises but I had been noticing this ab roller thing at my gym and was thinking I should try that. I bought one at home since it was cheap and thought let me try it out at home first. One fine day, I was at home and thought this was the time. I laid down the mat, put the roller in front of me and extended. Seemed fine but I felt I was not putting my weight on the roller enough to feel my abs. Second try in, I go again this time holding it more tight and on the way back, I brought it a little too back, mat slipped and WHAM! My chin goes straight to the floor and I could feel things flying out of my ear. I curl up on the floor because of the pain and blaming myself for this idea, expecting it to go away but it's not. Stood up, head starts spinning and I hold my chin, hoping no one would notice this and i wouldn't have to explain how I got this dent to everyone. I look back into my hands and I see blood all over. Flash forward ahead, had to go hospital to stop the bleeding, I have 3 stitches on my chin, it hurts to chew and my eardrums feel like someone's hitting it from inside. Now, I'm lying down in my bed and wishing I had stuck to crunches and leg raises. No more excercise using things with wheels for me!","Used an ab roller for the first time.

"TIFU by getting a pen cap stuck in my cast nearly amputating my arm
This was years ago when I was 12, got a cast for a fractured thumb. When it would get itchy I would stick pens in there and one day a cap got stuck, overtime I would get this really sharp stinging pain on my wrist, but didn't think much of it since it would go away quick. I would skate a lot and get sweaty so it would smell. When they cut off my cast it was full of blood inside and the pen cap was digging it's way into my wrist, a foul smell and was clearly infected, pus everywhere. Doctor said if I waited a days longer that it possibly would have needed to be amputated.

"TIFU by not watching my step!!
So I'm not a tall person average if consider 5'8 an average hight. But after 30 years I realised that even people of average hight like mine should look where they walk. 

The day started as usual woke up, worked out, took my shots, ate some food and off I was to work. For some reason work did not have the same usual feeling. Things were fucked up. 

Not going into the work thing but after grinding for 5hrs straight I really needed a smoke and numb my brain with some reels. I now hope I took my friends along and this would not have happened. 

There I was earphones plugged in, doom scrolling Instagram waiting for the lift to open, once it did I started to walk out and felt something bump my leg. Thinking I hit someones bag I looked up to apologise and saw no one. I looked down and then the horror stuck - it was not a bag it was a person I bumped into. 

In front of me there was a man on his back with his legs up in the air trying to figure out what just happended to him. He sits up and our eyes meet. All I could see was rage in his eyes and I felt earth shatering embarrassment. But I didn't know I had a dark side that kinda wanted to laugh (i didnt). 

I apologized and tried to help him up, but he was not having any of it. I went to grab his bottle that fell a little far away and when I turned I realized he fell again trying to get up. By this time I was biting my lip but I still did not laugh because he tipped again as his bag fell over making him kinda do a somersault when he fell again. 

At this point other folks were watching and it was at this part I started thinking that I might need a new job cause we had recently finished a sensitivity training about acceptance of people and not discriminating. Those training slides were now flash cards in my head and then I finally realized he had stood up and I still had his bottle in my hand. I gave him his bottle and apologized again. He did not say a word to me. His pause felt like forever. He walks into the lift and all he says before the door closed -"" Look where you walk.""

Now his words are haunting me and all I am waiting is call from HR.","- Absentmindely bumped into a short heightened person, making him fall. He told me to ""Look where I walk"".

"TIFU By answering to a former Friends with Benefits
Kontext: I'm (22M) am in a relationship with my GF (23F). I'm insanely in love with her and have been so for our whole 1.5 year relationship. But for months our Sex life has started declining. This has a physical reason so I'm not too hurt about that. But for the same time her attention to me started dwindling as well and it doesnt seem like she finds me attractive or desirable anymore. I put in great efforts to change this but I just feel like I'm bugging her all the Time. Now a few days ago a former friends with benefits texted me that she broke up with her boy friend and to come visit whenever me and my GF broke up. Pretty rude but I took it as a joke because I trust her very much and appreciate her as a Person. Because of that we started chatting, everything normal apart of some advances that I shut down, and I told her about my Problem with my GF and asked what I should do about it. I was very vulnerable and honest and she gave me some very good advice but after some time shifted to saying how horny she was and what she would wanted me to do to her and for some reason I replied. It was only two sentences until I realized what I'd done and immediately told her I'll hang up. After going for a walk I texted her again saying that this will not happen again and that I will Block her if she does sth like this again.

"TIFU by misspelling pedophile my whole life.
For as long as I can remember, I thought the word was spelled ""pedofile."" It made perfect sense to me. File? Like a criminal file? It checked out. No need to question it. I read it that way, heard it that way, and confidently typed it that way. And then one day, everything changed.

I was in an online argument with someone who accused me of pedophilia—because, of course, that’s where all great spelling realizations happen. The one i had an argument with then corrected me:

""You're the R-word for spelling it wrong. you mean pedophile, not pedofile."" I scoffed. Clearly, they were mistaken. But before I clapped back with a snarky response, I hesitated. Something about their confidence made me second-guess myself. So, in a moment of rare humility, I did what I should have done years ago—I googled the lyrics of Not Like Us... ""Certified Pedophiles.""

And there it was. Pedophile. With a ""ph.""

I stared at the screen in disbelief. How? Why? Who decided this? My whole life had been a lie. I immediately started overanalyzing everything. Why ph? Why not f? English is already a disaster, and this was just another layer of nonsense. I mean, we say photo, not fotto, so obviously ph makes an “f” sound—but why?

And that’s when it hit me: I had never actually seen it spelled out properly. I had just assumed I knew. My brain had auto-corrected reality to fit my own version of events. in Estonia, we spell it with an F (Pedofiil).

So now, whenever I see the word pedophile written correctly, I get a tiny pang of embarrassment, a reminder of the time I spent years confidently being wrong. But at least I learned something valuable: Never trust your brain too much—it might be lying to you.

"TIFU by Spending 2 Hours Debugging a Completely Fictional API
**","**: Spent an entire night trying to use an API that literally does not exist, then had to build the entire thing myself out of pure spite.

So, there I was at 1:17 AM, diving into what was supposed to be a simple integration with a text-to-speech model. The documentation looked pristine - detailed endpoints, clear examples, everything a developer could dream of. Seemed like a quick job.

NARRATOR: It was not a quick job.

The Debugging Descent into Madness:

What followed was a multi-stage descent into technical hell that would make Dante's Inferno look like a pleasant stroll:

1. **The Gradio Version Roulette**
First, I discovered Gradio's API parameters are a moving target. Versions 3.x, 4.x, and 5.x each handle API endpoints differently:
- Older versions: Automatic `/api/predict/` routes
- Mid-versions: `enable_api=True`
- Latest version: `api_name=""/endpoint""`

Each attempt met with a new error:
`TypeError: Blocks.launch() got an unexpected keyword argument 'enable_api'`
`TypeError: Blocks.launch() got an unexpected keyword argument 'api_open'`
`{""detail"":""Not Found""}`

2. **Configuration Chaos**
Debug prints revealed the true horror:
- Checking Gradio version: 5.16.0 ✓
- Confirming code has `api_name=""/generate_audio""` ✓
- Actual server response: Minimal `{'type': 'column'}` configuration

3. **The Container Conundrum**
Docker added another layer of complexity:
- Verified file contents: Correct ✓
- Rebuilt container multiple times: Nothing changed
- Tried volume mounts, different base images: Still no luck

4. **Endpoint Existential Crisis**
Curl requests became a ritual of despair:
`curl -X POST http://localhost:7860/generate_audio`
`# Response: {""detail"":""Not Found""}`

`curl -X POST http://localhost:7860/api/generate_audio`
`# Response: {""detail"":""Not Found""}`

`curl -X POST http://localhost:7860/api/predict/`
`# Response: {""detail"":""Not Found""}`

5. **The Gradio Documentation Betrayal**
The docs showed a beautiful, comprehensive API endpoint:
`api_name=""/generate_audio""`
Reality: A phantom endpoint that existed only in documentation.

The Breaking Point:
After two hours of increasingly manic debugging, the horrifying realization hit: **THE API DOESN'T EXIST**.

They had written a FULL, COMPREHENSIVE API DOCUMENTATION for an API that was PURELY FICTIONAL. It was like reading a travel guide for Narnia - beautifully written, completely imaginary.

So what did I do? I built the entire damn API myself. Added FastAPI endpoints, implemented proper request handling, created streaming responses - the works. All while nursing a growing rage and an obscene amount of coffee.

The kicker? Once implemented, it worked perfectly. 😭

"TIFU by assuming we were going north
Just a mini fuck up because the only consequence was hot pasta becoming warm pasta. If it doesn't qualify, I will accept post deletion at mods discretion.

My brother (18M) and I (29F) were out doing deliveries for Uber. More specifically I was doing the deliveries and he was there to not be bored at home. We just finished a pickup when he got a call from our mom who wanted cake and pasta from the Cheesecake Factory. I set the app to not accept any new orders, and after we finished he placed the order for pickup.

The order was a piece of celebration cake and a bowl of pasta, and it would be ready in 20 minutes. We were in west Anaheim and the restaurant was in Brea (for those of you in or familiar with OC, we were near Beach Boulevard and Ball Road, and we had to go to the Brea Mall). My brother had the Door Dash app open for pick up and said to turn right. I told him I actually know which way to go and instead went straight.

My plan was to go north until I saw the 91, hop on eastbound, get on the northbound 57 from there and get off just east of the mall. I drove for a solid 10 minutes and only when I saw Valley View did I realize we were going west.

I apologized to my brother, told him I thought we were going the wrong way, and now our 20 minute pick up ended up being 20 minutes late. Props to the Cheescake Factory for keeping the pasta kinda warm, but it was definitely colder than it should have been, our mom noticed before my brother and I even explained the slip up.

"TIFU by accidentally killing a deer
So I was driving back home from an eatery at the nearby town earlier tonight. Several miles from home I see two deer, both does, one was in the ditchbank the other smack in the road. Before I could react enough to put on my brakes I ran into it and stopped soon after. I didn't know what to do so I drove away but I felt bad as I took an animal's life for without a good reason. At home I told mom and dad, we got a flashlight that was big, and checked the truck. Well, blood is all over my axle, wheel hub and bottom of engine. A bit of smelly deer hair stuck on the front plastic piece where someone can put a plate on and which I plucked mostly out. It is supposed to rain tomorrow so I can use the water to clean the mess.","I accidentally ran into a deer at night.

"TIFU by attempting to start a restaurant with my partner
My partner (F30) and I (M28) have been together for several years and have always talked about starting a business together. We actually met in hospitality and have always been cooking and working in restaurants. Because of this, our main goal has always been to open our very own restaurant.

For the last year or so, we had been fine-tuning our idea to create something with media appeal but also food so good that it would be respected in its own right. Everything had been going well, we had been saving money and both took night classes in subjects like business administration to improve our skills in preparation.

Here's where things got sticky. While we had both agreed on the name ""Mr. Perverts,"" at some point, we each settled on completely different themes in our heads. I thought that for Instagram, social media appeal, and a more diverse menu, the restaurant should feature items like hotdogs, bananas, and donuts. She, on the other hand, decided a more subtle approach would be better, opting for ice creams and other sweets.

This really became an issue when we started looking at places to rent. After one inspection, it escalated into a full-on argument at max volume. Neither of us would budge on our ideas, she had already designed the logo, but I had already begun working on patents for special menu items (such as a banana in liquid nitrogen that grows shortly after being served). She stormed out, took the car keys, and left me to catch the train home.

When I got home, she had pretty much packed up all of her stuff and was about to leave. I noticed she had also taken heaps of the paperwork for ""Mr. Perverts,"" including my patents. That’s when everything exploded.

We started shouting at each other, louder than ever before. I accused her of stealing my ideas. She shot back that my ideas were ruining hers. I told her I wouldn’t let her take what I had worked on, and she said she was going to destroy them because they were ""tainting"" her vision.

Neither of us was backing down. It pretty much completely stopped being about the restaurant anymore and was just about everything else. After ten or so minutes of yelling, we both just stopped and sat down on the couch. After about five minutes, we both admitted the same thing: we needed a break from each other.

All our friends told us that starting a restaurant together would end in tears, but we thought that because we had a novel, hilarious, and delicious-sounding idea, it would be different. In retrospect, I think I should have just created it entirely on my own and let my partner work on her own separate project.","My partner and I attempted to start a business together, and now we’ve decided we need to take a break from each other.","My partner and I got into a huge argument over our idea for a restaurant.

"TIFU by walking in on my dad playing “dirty” game
This just happened a few minutes ago. I am 31 and recently moved back home due to personal reasons. I renting two rooms from my parents who are both in their 60s. I have been here for a few months and they often talk to me about staying longer to save more money. I have finally started thinking about staying longer so I have been making myself more at home. One way I have done this is by getting my weight bench and bike trainer from my storage unit to set up in the basement. I brought them home last week and forgot a couple parts so I went and grabbed them today. Mu parents were out all day and I’ve just been doing my thing and finally decided to put the bench together because my mom went to take a nap and I wanted to give her some peace (my living room and bedroom are adjacent to their bedroom). I asked her to come into my living room to see something (bday present for my dad) and she didn’t so I walked into the hallway to see my mother in a shirt and underwear. Huh, kinda weird but I didn’t think much of it. I thought she left her jeans downstairs to wash like she sometimes does.

I went to my truck, got the parts, and headed to the basement. As I turned the corner my dad was sitting in his computer chair looking at me. (He has had a computer in the basement for forever bc all other rooms were occupied). He acted normal, we talked for a second, and I walked by to start working. 

That’s when I saw it. He was playing a silly looking game where there was a lady in a house and you can walk around. Since I like playing PC games I immediately was intrigued and went up to the screen at ask what it was. He said “a silly game” to which I replied, “like an escape room?!”. He just stared at me and I walked away after a second thinking he was just being a silly old guy. 

As I start working he said “it’s a dirty game” and I could only think to say “gross dad”. AND THEN I KEPT WORKING because I didn’t know what else to do. I didn’t want to shame him and run away nor did I want to leave and be like “I’ll leave you to it then”. So I ended up putting a couple bolts in and then leaving for the reason of the tools being wet…from condensation since they were warming up from being in the garage…as I was saying it I had to stop myself from saying “moist”.

So yeah, maybe I should just move out so my dad can jerk off in peace.",; saw mom in her underwear then proceeds to go into the basement and see dad playing a porn game.,I walked in on my dad playing a “dirty” game.

"TIFU buy getting my beard trimmed at great clips
I’m boycotting great clips

For years I’d gone to great clips for a haircut. I had a lady there that did a great job cutting my hair for years. Before my wedding 3.5 months ago I changed to a proper barber. Went to them for a few months. Funds have been low lately so I decided to go back to great clips for the cheaper haircut as it was next to the grocery store I was going to. Walk-in no problem and sit down. It’s great clips. They aren’t busy. 

Same lady I had before. Cool. She asks what I want for my hair so I tell her same as before. She then asks about my beard. At this point I’d been growing it out for about 7 months and it was about 5 or so inches. I’d had occasional maintenance by my new guy and trimmed as needed. But it was getting to where I wanted it and my wife loved it but thought it needed some maintenance by my guy. 

Here’s where I made my mist  be ake. I trusted this lady with my hair. But I hadn’t seen her since I grew my beard. Unfortunately I told her maybe cut a half inch off and clean up the sides. 

The haircut was great. But gentleman, she has done me wrong. She whipped out the trimmers and before I could say much she cut about 4 inches off down the center. To her cr",,I’m boycotting great clips because they aren’t busy.
"TIFU by 'agreeing' to give my wife another child
Obligatory this wasn't today, but a number of weeks ago when these particular FUs began.

I had a couple years or so of relational FUs, and people on here have called me a sociopath before and I can't blame them. My wife Fiona and I have a stable, if somewhat average, marriage relationship. The conflict at this point is that she desperately wants another child and I very clearly do not. We lost our son (0M) in late 2023, and at that time I had told Fiona that we should wait a full year before making any decisions about whether to try for another child. In my mind, at least, this gave me breathing room because I knew I'd have at least one more year of a semblance of personal freedom without the looming dread of a third child hanging over me.

In late 2024, Fiona started pushing that we should have marriage counselling. I didn't want it because I didn't see it as important. And I also knew that it would be a catalyst for this ongoing conflict. And, of course, I turned out to be right, when I finally relented and agreed to have marriage counselling.

Now. I don't know if this is a shitty counsellor or what, but since we started he has basically sided with her and is telling me that it's wrong to deny Fiona another child if that's what she wants. To be fair, he has also pointed out that Fiona has control issues and I have an avoidance problem. Those things are probably not incorrect. But now that the counsellor has basically allied with Fiona, she has doubled down on trying to pressure me into agreeing to have a third child.

So finally, FML, I 'agreed,' just to get her to stop pushing me on the subject. I feel like a jackass though, because I have zero intention of giving her another child at this point. I've gone as far as faking O's in bed the past few days (she was fertile and was therefore initiating unprotected sex every night for the past couple days). And the terrifying thing about this is that I have realized that not only is the ball still in my court (because no O equals no pregnancy), but I'm also lapsing into an old habit of essentially lying to Fiona by making such pretenses. I do somewhat wish I could just be honest with her, but the fact that the marriage counsellor is siding with her has basically made any argument I make into a moot point which gets steamrolled by something akin to, ""Well I deserve to have what I want!""

It's all just a bit F\*ked. And I'm not sure what to do at this point. Divorce is not an option due to how it would torpedo my life overall, and separation would have a similar net result as divorce anyway. So I have to basically live another lie, or cave in and mess up my personal autonomy even further. So I guess this is a TIFU and a TIWFU (Tomorrow I Will Fuck Up).","Wife has been pushing me for marriage counselling, and now she is weaponizing it against me to get pregnant.","I agree to give my wife another child, but the counsellor has sided with my wife and is now trying to pressure me into agreeing to give her another child."
"TIFU by Sending Mother’s Day flowers for Valentine’s Day
I (23f) met this girl (20f) online, and she’s from Russia. I wanted to do something sweet for her so I decided to send her flowers. Since there are some shipping restrictions, I figured it would be easier to just order from a local shop near her using an app that shows flower shops around her. I’m new to this whole “sending flowers” thing, so I had no idea what I was doing, but I figured I’d just pick something cute without being too forward.

Now, it's Valentine’s Day and I was pumped to send her something really cute. So at midnight (because I’m just that excited), I decided to place the order so the flowers would arrive on her Valentine’s Day.

But here’s where I completely fucked up… I didn’t bother to translate anything on the website about the flowers, I just went with what looked cute. I thought I was safe because the flowers didn’t look too romantic, and I didn’t want to come off as too strong. Fast forward to this morning, and I decide to double check everything (because you know, I’m an idiot) and actually translate the description.

And then it hits me… The first line of the description says, “Ко дню мамы,” which translates to “For Mother’s Day” 😭

So… yeah. My first ever flower delivery is actually a Mother’s Day bouquet, and in a few hours the girl I’ve been talking to will be receiving flowers meant for someone’s mom on Valentine’s Day.

"TIFU by outing myself to old coworkers.
I’ve been having chronic back pain and needed to get a doctors note for an MRI so I went to an orthopedic to get one. I’m super busy so I had to get an appointment super close to my work time so it didn’t interfere with school. I have a new job from the old one so I picked an orthopedic that was very close to my job, and easily get an appointment for. The orthopedic site I went to happened to be the one I interned at a few months prior.

They got me, rushed me in and then didn’t tell me what exams I was having done fully or confirm my name and dob at all💀. 

Turns out, I forgot that this doctor always orders a pelvis with the lower back. …shit

Everything felt so rushed that I didn’t really get a chance to refuse it when they already set me up for it (feeling for centering is same for both pelvis and lumbar spine) and remember what it might show and frankly it would’ve made things weirder to refuse it.  

If anyone knows anything about x-ray, soft tissue can show up if the technique is great. And typical male versus female pelvises look pretty different. So basically my pelvis came out not looking like a typical male one despite starting treatment as a minor. Very bad for me in the red county im in. 

Unfortunately, just as that first image was shot one of the techs that didn’t treat me the best while I was there popped up behind the console. That made me panic. Then they started telling me I should have remembered these protocols from months ago (basically wanted me to position my own xrays). Always questioned me for things I did/talked down to me. Also, this person was never there on Thursdays so I was blindsided. 

I personally thought that it wasn’t gonna show a lot more than it did when I saw it at the end and further inspected it on my own time. I basically F-ed up because every tech that’s good as their skills could spot the distinction immediately. 

Obviously, there’s post processing that has to be done (digital markers), but as I was leaving the room, my pelvis image was up on the screen. There were three other x-rays that had to be post processed. I know how these techs work and since they are in twos/one extra, one of them puts the markers on the image and crops after they’re taken.

"TIFU by buying condoms
Obligatory not today, but last week at the beginning of February I had arrived home from a work trip that took me out of state for the whole month of January. During my stay I went to target and bought groceries and toiletries to last me the month while I stay cooped in my hotel room. One of my purchases was a 10 pack of Trojan condoms. And guys I swear I bought them to masterbate because I figured, I don’t wanna use my bath towels, I don’t wanna use my socks or clothes since I’ll be washing my clothes once a week and don’t want my clothes to have my man juice on them, to top it off the AC was broken in my room, the heater never passed 60 degrees so I would lay under the covers and go to town. I was being comfortable and clean. I didn’t think much of it at the time. 
So anyways I fly back home on Friday because I was able to leave a week early from my trip and wanted to enjoy a whole week free with my Girlfriend. She picks me up from the airport, we go eat we grab drinks and go home, cuddle and just enjoy her company. 
On Sunday she goes through my phone and goes into my target app, sees my recent in-store purchases and sees I bought condoms. She flips her shit, grabs my stuff packs them in bags, grabs my dog and kicks us out. And for the life of me I couldn’t explain my side I couldn’t explain why I bought them. She immediately started accusing me of cheating, wanting to cheat, or prepping to cheat on her while I was on my business trip. 
I tried my best to reassure her, I told her babe, I was on the phone with you everyday, we texted everyday we went asleep on the phone every night. 
Nothing could change her mind. Now I’m blocked on Instagram, text a calls and I’m pretty sure through emails too.  
Now i know how it looks I’ve had all my guy friends say the same thing, “who uses condoms to jerk off?” But it wasn’t my intention to cheat. I loved her I cherished her I spoiled her. 
This one hurts because I cared so deeply for her and love her. It sucks even more knowing a misunderstanding took her away from me. We talked about having kids, moving in together and starting that life I’ve always wanted.  So to go from talking everyday, having someone there for me and being loved to absolutely nothing and radio silence is the worst feeling in the world. 
Now, I can’t entirely blame her for not wanting to believe me. We did go through a rough patch in the beginning of our relationship when an ex texted me and I replied without thinking. It wasn’t flirty it was just a hey I’m sorry for how things ended between us and that was it. She saw it and held it against me since. So that’s the reason she spent an hour on my phone, dissecting every app, just looking for anything. And I reassured her, you can go through my phone anytime you want I promise I’m not gonna cheat on you or talk to anyone I just want you. 
She’s gone through my phone maybe 2 times a week and every time there was nothing I was hiding. 
I know there was trust issues and I was trying my best to reassure her. We got back together after that incident and I’ve been an open book with her and honest. 
So I know you guys are gonna say I deserved it and she’s right to leave. But Damm I miss her and I didn’t mean any harm by it. 
So guys am I cooked? Will time heal us?","went on a work trip to Virginia in the middle of winter storms, bought condoms to jerk off comfortably in my warm bed, GF saw transaction and broke up and blocked me on everything and can’t even explain myself. Left heartbroken.

"TIFU by purposefully overflowed my schools toilet...
Our school is unique, and on Wednesdays we have to change clothes in the girls upstairs bathroom. We were changing and someone mentioned that one of the toilets looked to be clogged. Despite knowing if it was clogged the water would rise, I tested it out. It was, in fact, extremely clogged. The rest of the girls took turns daring each other to flush again to make it overflow and eventually two other people did it. After the second though, toilet water began gushing from it in all directions. Everyone started scrambling to save their clothes and bags whilst screaming. Well, our teacher was MAD. He didn't know that we overflowed the toilet though.

"TIFU by sending an inappropriate message to my best friends sister instead of a message of support
This just happened about 30 minutes ago. My best friend, M's dad passed away yesterday. I'm also friends with her sister L, but we're not super close. Also, L is a practicing Mormon. 

I'm struggling with grief myself after losing my dad last year. There are lots of memories popping up from this time last year when we were full of hope and excitement after he was released from rehab, so I can understand how my friend and her sister are feeling. 

I decided to send L a gif essentially saying ""you're into my thoughts and I'm sending you love"". Unfortunately, I didn't have my glasses on, so when I looked through my pictures, I saw the one I thought was the right message. Well it wasn't. 

What I ended up sending was a picture of a cute, animated hedgehog that said ""Mrs. Hedgehog is feeling extra prickly than usual and just might headbutt a cunt today!"" 

I was mortified! Once I realized my faux pas, I removed the picture, apologized and sent the right one. Then I laughed for a solid 10 minutes. Crying, stomach hurting laughter. My family was wondering what was going on, and I couldn't speak, but I was finally able to explain it to them. 

Thankfully, L got a kick out of it (as did M) so we all had a much needed good laugh at my expense.","my best friends dad passed away last night. Tried to send her (Mormon) sister an uplifting gif, ended up sending her an inappropriate picture instead. We all had a much needed laugh.

"TIFU by accidentally painting myself blue
I was feeling really sore and tired from my leg day today and decided I should draw a hot bath and use one of the bath bombs I got for Christmas to relax. While the water is filling up the tub I unwrap the bath bomb and I noticed that I must have accidentally got some of the powder on my fingers and it stained them blue. No biggy I thought to myself I'll just rinse them off in the sink and didn't think anything of it. Once the tub was full I submerged my body into the relaxing hot water grabbed the bath bomb and plopped it into the water slowly hearing the contents fizzle and disperse.

I was totally lost in the moment, feeling my body relax as the hot water relaxed my muscles. Then I noticed there was a dark blue ring around the tub and my forearm which was partially in the water was stained blue when I went to grab my phone. Me being the idiot I am was like ehh it will just wash off. Instead of draining the water right away, I decided to soak for awhile.

Big mistake... When I was done soaking I drained the tub and the entire thing was tinted blue, after looking at the tub I turned to look at the mirror and the lower half of my body and back looked like Marty Wolf week 3 of being blue. I could still see my skin but I was definitely tinted a shade of dark blue. In horror I rushed to hop in the shower to try and return to my normal skin tone. I got my body wet, no dice, still the same shade. I lather myself up with 1 round of body wash. I watch as the once clear liquid starts to turn blue. After round 1 my skin looks a lot less blue but my body still has the essence of blue on it and there were still stubborn parts where I was still deeply blue. I end up having to lather up and rinse off 1 more time with body wash, 2 more times with dawn on the really stubborn areas, just to have parts of my body still look like I opened a rigged duffle bag full of money naked 6 weeks ago. I also had to deep clean my bathtub so I don't accidentally turn myself blue again with the residual dye that has laid claim to the real estate in the tub","Wanting to relax my sore and exhausted body from a hard workout I drew a bath, and dropped a bath bomb in the water that turned me into the off brand Marty Wolf.

"TIFU Broken trust
TIFU I ended my last marriage in 2020. It was very traumatic and I felt like I would never find love again. I was scared, I never wanted to feel that pain again. I was single for 4 years, happily so, until one day I thought I would like to go on some dates. Online dating is ROUGH. In April 2024 I met the most amazing man. We talked for hours every day never sending nudes or FaceTiming. Just hours and hours of getting to know each other. 
Our first date was amazing. We really had a connection. It didn’t take long and I was started to have feelings. That was scarier than being alone. In my soul I knew this man wasn’t here to hurt me. I took a deep breath and a leap of faith and I went all in. It was fast and furious. I felt safe, I felt happy, I felt home. He tells me he feels the same. 

A lot of things happened, he planned to move in. He asked me to marry him, we told my kids we would be moving at the end of the school year. One month I was short on my car payment. I paid what I could. My pride stopped me from telling him. I couldn’t ask for help. It wasn’t his problem. This went on a few months. I kept thinking I would figure it out. I always figure it out.
Then it’s January and we are on a weekend trip together and my daughter calls….my car has been repoed. I felt like my whole world has caved in. There is no way not to tell him now. I waited until the next day and even though I was about to puke I told him. Of course he offered to fix it all, $2,000 without question. We drove all the way home in silence.

"TIFU by tripping and banging my forehead
I'm dangerously klutzy - have broken bones a a result. 

Last weekend,  I was reaching for something on the far side of the bathtub,  resting one hand on the stack of towels next to it, when the stack collapsed.  Somehow,  this led to me reeling across the room and landing on the floor next to the toilet. 

I barked the palm of my hand. I hurt my shoulder (likely aggravating an existing rotator cuff issue). And I banged my head against the drywall, leading to a small goose egg hidden by my hair. 

Annoying,  but honestly not the worst I've done to myself (tops would be the time I rolled my ankle and somersaulted down some stairs). 

But in the past 48 hours,  as that goose egg has resolved,  it's developed into a VERY visible bruise all over the left side of my forehead.  And I need to take a photo to post for work. Yeesh.

"TIFU by drinking caffeine
This actually happened about two days ago but as you will see from the story, I have completely fuckes up my internal clock.

I have ADHD and for years I have always told people that I can't have caffeine due to it making me sleepy. I always have people look at me with skepticism about it, plus I drink soda pretty often and am fine, so it made sense. I got so many weird looks over the years I started to doubt myself.

So two days ago, at around 3am on Tuesday, I had pulled an all nighter. I knew I had to go to class later that day and I didn't trust myself to take a nap and wake up to an alarm. Plus, at that time, I didn't feel all that tired, I just knew I would later. So after consulting some friends who do drink energy drinks, I went to a 24 hour gas station, got a monster and something to eat before hand.

3 sips, I took 3 sips, and I knew I fucked up. I emailed my professor, texted my family to not wake me for class because I wouldn't be going, and passed out at 4am. I woke up at 1pm because I had a meeting, stayed awake but barely lucid, and managed to fall asleep again at night with no trouble. On Wednesday, I was still feeling it and fell asleep around 5pm, waking at around 7pm, and once again being able to fall asleep for a full nights rest.

"TIFU by eating a fried pickle
Basically what the title says, although this happened almost a week ago. We had gone out to eat for a friend’s birthday and we went to a sort of “nice” burger restaurant. Think hipster over priced burgers with unique combos. Someone at the table had ordered fried pickles and offered them around. Normally fried pickles are the chip version, so even if they are piping hot it’s pretty manageable. Well these were pickle spears, and they were thick. I knew they were super hot, but I had underestimated just how hot these things were. Backstory, I had to have several of my front teeth replaced with veneers due to weak and brittle teeth (genetic) and due to this my front teeth are very rounded and smooth and I often have trouble biting through things. I picked up this full fried pickle spear that was hotter than a fresh lava flow and took a bite. My teeth betrayed me and I was struggling to bite through the skin of the pickle, and because we were out in public I didn’t want to spit the pickle out due to embarrassment, so I let the molten pickle sit behind my front teeth against the roof of my mouth for what seemed like an eternity (probably less than a minute). Immediately after I successfully bit through the pickle I knew I fucked up. I could feel what felt like a waxy substance on the roof of my mouth and I thought the pickle skin had gotten stuck in my teeth so I started rubbing it. Turns out it was blistering skin on the roof of my mouth that I peeled out. Then another layer, then another layer. This was blistering almost instantly. I tried to eat the rest of my food and did so through the pain. I had burned my mouth before and just assumed it would take a few days but heal completely. Since then the pain has been getting worse, but more concentrated to a tiny spot right behind my two front teeth. I am struggling eating, drinking, even talking and swallowing because of the pain. No more blistering but I am just so ready for this to heal. So yeah, has anybody else had an experience like this?? Definitely going to be letting my food cool from now on.","ate an insanely hot fried pickle and ended up with blisters on the roof of my mouth, I’ve been struggling to eat/ drink for a week since.","Tried to bite through a fried pickle spear, ended up with blistering skin on the roof of my mouth."
"TIFU by trying to make a gourmet meal and almost burning my kitchen down.
So, I decided to channel my inner Gordon Ramsay and make a fancy dinner. I got all the ingredients, followed the recipe to the letter, and was feeling pretty confident. The dish was supposed to be this elaborate three-course meal with a main course that involved flambéing something. I mean, how hard could it be, right?

First, I started with the appetizer. It was supposed to be a simple salad, but somehow I managed to cut my finger while chopping the veggies. Not a great start, but I powered through. Then came the main course. The recipe called for setting the dish on fire to get that perfect charred flavor. I lit the match and... whoosh! The flames shot up way higher than I expected. I panicked and tried to put it out with a dish towel, which caught on fire too. 

In the chaos, I knocked over a bottle of oil, which spilled everywhere and made the flames even worse. The smoke alarm started blaring, and my dog, who had been peacefully napping, freaked out and started barking like crazy. I finally managed to douse the flames with a fire extinguisher, but not before the kitchen was filled with smoke and the smell of burnt food.

By the time I got everything under control, the kitchen looked like a war zone. The main course was a charred mess, and the dessert I had in the oven was now a burnt lump. To top it all off, my dog had somehow managed to eat the only part of the meal that turned out okay – the salad.",; lesson learned: stick to takeout.

"TIFU by not paying attention
The actual FU was a couple of weeks ago, but I only discovered it earlier today.

So almost everything I buy, I get through an online site. One of the latest I found has really high quality stuff and really cheap stuff. Some of the cheap stuff is crap, lots of it isn’t.

Anyway, I’d ordered something that I forgot about, so when it came, surprise! I immediately ordered it for a friend who had just said whatever was on the clothes. So I had to get her address. Ok, done. So far, so good. It took a few weeks, but she finally got it and all was well. I figured that since I was already on the site, I might as well get much needed clothes for a vacation that actually fit me (since I gained some weight,) because I’m going on vacation at the end of the month and will be visiting family after, so I’ll be gone a while and need enough to wear. 

This was at the beginning of February, and I assumed even if it took 3 weeks, I’d still get everything before I leave. I had fun, took my time, yada yada yada, and got a whole spring/summer wardrobe for about $125. Yay me again. 

I got VERY early retirement, so I revel in not knowing what day of the week it is, nor the date. 

Well, I had a dentist appointment this morning which I actually got to on time, correct day, since my phone reminded me. Of course my mouth is a mess, and I have to get my first root canal ever. Do they let you go to the dentist stoned? Seriously. Anyway, I had to make an appointment with their oral surgeon before they’d do the root canal, so I pulled over after I left to just get it over with. 

I’m doing my thing, and it’s easier than I thought it would be. As I’m doing my thing, my phone decides (which it always does, which annoys the fuck out of me,) to realize I haven’t touched it in a while, so it seems that it stores up my notifications until I start doing my thing. Doing doing beep beep boop doing. One of the doings (pronounced doy-ng) is from that site I bought all my clothes from. Yay me AGAIN. I mean, me? Did a bunch of things right? No way. 

*sigh* Nope. I check the notification and it says that my whole wardrobe will be delivered tomorrow. So yeah! I’m on a roll. I read the whole thing, and it’s going to my friend’s house. 1,000 miles away (I’m in New York, she’s in Florida.) I never changed the shipping address back to my house when I was talking to my friend, and tomorrow she’s getting my clothes. 🤦‍♀️

So now I’m scrambling to get in touch with her. I text her through another platform (that I hate, but use because so many people in my life use it.) I’m waiting for her to respond, but don’t look at the phone again until I’m home. She doesn’t respond. She was online 40 minutes ago, but blew me off. I text her again, and find another platform hoping she’ll pay attention to it. Maybe? Nope. I don’t have her phone number. Can’t make her a contact to send the message, never mind call her cell. So I post on her wall and she finally responds. I tell her what happened and she hasn’t gotten the package yet. It should be to her house by tomorrow, and she’ll go to the post office and send it to me. I hope it gets to her in time to send it to me, or I’m going to Costa Rica nekkid.

Moral of the story: Pay attention after you do something nice for someone else so you don’t screw yourself later. And if you do, make sure your nice gesture is to a reliable person.","I sent a friend a surprise from an online site, and didn’t change the shipping address back to my home.

"TIFU by trying to 3D print a miniature
So I did something peak stupid last night, and figured y'all could have a cringe at my stupidity. 

Was up late playing around with The Hero Forge miniature creator online, and finally had finished up another miniature for one of my Dungeons and Dragons characters, a Kenku Samurai who talks by writing in a book, paid for the STL file, went over to my printer and grabbed the SD card and went to plug it in. But for whatever reason it couldn't be read and said it was corrupted, I thought that was strange, as I hadn't used my 3D printer for a while and all the SD card had been doing was sit there untouched. I tried opening it on the printer, SD card Initiation failed, ""okay that's even weirder"" I thought, I tried a few more times on the printer, a few more times on my computer, tried blowing in the microSD to USB adapter, but nothing I was trying would work. 

Then I had an idea for a hypothesis test, The SD card in my Nintendo Switch! Of course! I saved my current Tears of The Kingdom save, shut down the console, and grabbed the SD card, this one worked! Folder opened up perfectly fine, awesome! I drag and dropped the sliced Gcode of my little corvid warrior and brought it over to my printer, but same as before, the 3D printer couldn't initialise the SD card for some reason. Annoyed that I now have to try and look up what's wrong with my printer, I brought the SD Card back over to my computer to remove the Gcode and put it back in my switch. 

That's when the computer told me it needed to be formatted.... shit. I stared at the screen. Thought ""okay don't panic"" and took out the SD card and put it in my switch and turned it on. ""you need to format this SD card in order for it to work with this console."" And that's when my heart sank. Across a whole library of games, 1000+ hours collectively, up in flames like that. 250 hours in Breath of The Wild, probably another 100 in Tears, 120 hours of Celeste, 30 hours of A Short Hike, 40 hours of Hellblade, 80 hours of Hotline Miami, another hundred for Animal Crossing, even halfway through my first playthrough of the first Red Dead Redemption, the list goes on. Needless to say I was incredibly frustrated and decided to go to bed, and here I am just realising the gravity of what I did, hoping and praying that at least some of my saves made it to the cloud when I get home.","I went to 3D Print one of my miniatures, wound up with no miniature and erasing 1000+ hours worth of gameplay from my Switch instead.","Tried to 3D print a miniature, SD card failed, tried to format it to work with Nintendo Switch, tried 3D printing a game on my Nintendo 3D printer, failed again."
"TIFU by asking my friend what’s wrong
So yesterday I was at lunch with friends and this one guy I’ll call V looked sad like he had something on his mind I asked what’s wrong he said nothing we went back and forth till he gave in telling me he liked this person and he asked how to get over somebody because he knew it wouldn’t work and it would ruin the friendship. so we start talking about ways to try to get over someone I ask how close is he to this person and how often they talk so they could maybe distance themselves from them or maybe thinking on this from a long term perspective like if he wants to spend the rest of his life with J and or if he loves J out of desperation and loneliness or real love. we talk more then that friend who I’ll call J walks in hears what we’re talking about tries to help too, V seems hesitant to talk with J about it, but eventually J gets this feeling that it might be them then takes V out of the room asking if it was them V lies says it’s not J and they come back we talk more.
 today V and I are with another friend. they talk about what happened at lunch and I overhear and I find out it’s J, then it clicks why he was hesitant to talk with J about this person because the person is J. So V tells this other friend that he probably won’t tell J he likes them because I asked about it and J walked in and has a suspicion now.

"TIFU by asking out a girl who has a boyfriend
    Okay, so this is what happened. I (17M) was sitting on the train on my way home, and I saw this pretty girl across the train station from me. Since my friend had told me earlier that I had little time left to get a Valentine for Valentine’s Day and I should hurry up if I wanted one by then, I decided to take his advice and try asking her for her number. However, since I have no confidence and can’t talk to people, I just sat there (my seat) and looked at her for a bit, before telling myself that I’d never be able to ask her or any other girl out if I didn’t grow some balls and go do it. 

    So, I got up from my seat, and crossed over to the other side of the train where she was. But even when I was there, literally like one or two feet (30 or 61 cm for the non-Americans) away from her, I still couldn’t build up the courage to talk to her and I was too anxious because my brain kept on saying I shouldn’t even bother because she wouldn’t like me anyway. So, in trying to get up the courage to talk to her, I would continuously turn to look at her face then look away, which, yes, I am aware might have came across as creepy. 

     Eventually, the train I was on (which gave out announcements every time it arrived and left a new stop) announced that my stop was next, and I decided to just do it because if I didn’t, I’d lose my chance to forever. So, I tried to get her attention by talking to her, but she had headphones and didn’t seem to hear me. Then, I reached out to tap her on her shoulder on her shoulder (in hindsight, probably a bad idea to touch a stranger but I couldn’t think of any other way to get her attention at the time), and she looks up, taking off her headphones and saying something (I think it might have been something like an apology for not hearing me, but I honestly don’t remember too well so I won’t say that for sure here). 

     Anyways, after that I ask her (in a completely anxious rush so it probably comes out sounding like this), “I think you’re prettycuteandIwaswonderingifIcouldhaveyournumber?” [Corny, I know, but my only experience with romance is what I’ve seen in movies and read in books, so yeah.] Then, she says something that shocks me, as she replies, “I’m 17?” That’s typically not how you reply when you think someone your age is asking you out, so I assumed she thought I was either older or younger than her, which is something I get a lot [oldest I’ve heard from people before is 22, and the youngest I’ve heard is 14, which I definitely think is interesting, but that’s a topic for another day.] My immediate thought is that she probably thinks I’m older and being creepy by hitting on her, though, since that’s the kind of response I’ve seen girls give when older guys hit on them. 

     So obviously, I’m kind of terrified because now I’m worried she thinks I’m some kind of predator being a creep to her, so I tell her, “I’m 17 too” as an explanation so she won’t think that. Then, she’s like “I have a boyfriend,” and my hopes are kind of crushed, but I want to respect her and her relationship so I’m just like, “Oh uh alright,” and make my break for it, which thankfully isn’t hard as my train pulls into my stop soon after, and I head off of it.",I embarrassed myself by shooting my shot with a girl who turned out to already have a boyfriend.,"Asked out a girl who has a boyfriend on the train, she didn’t hear me."

Ok, this didn’t happen today. It takes place over the last few months, but I’m finally ready to talk about it. 

For most of 2024, I (30F) started experiencing increasingly worse symptoms of fatigue, loss of appetite, headaches and other similar symptoms. After a good amount of time, I got blood work done and was diagnosed with mild anemia. I was prescribed iron pills, but after taking them for a couple months I was still experiencing trouble.

"TIFU by bringing my boyfriend to the bar
I feel like this is the wrong subreddit for this but I don’t know what to do. It’s not a funny story. I feel evil. 

We’re on a trip in Europe. We’ve been arguing a bit but nothing too out of the ordinary. A few years ago I bought a condo that I soundly afford and it’s been sinking us ever since. I never have my own money. All my cards are maxed out. So he’s payed for everything on the trip. When I get paid I send him my money to pay him back but it’s become this viscous cycle where he’s essentially become my bank. He hates, I hate it. 

I’m just going to pause to explain how much our relationship means to me and how special I truly believe it is. We’ve been together almost 10 years even though we try not to count and we try not to say we’re a couple. We just really like hanging out. That’s what we usually say. He’s the only person I’ve ever met who keeps it real with me. Who sees the world with refreshing eyes. He’s my best fucking friend in the whole world and I can’t imagine my life without him. 

I used to be a really bad drinker. For a few years it was a party thing but there were always the times when I would get sad and drink to oblivion and almost every time I drank with friends I’d end up piling my guts out. It was a coping mechanism for me. It’s been a year now that I have it up after one particularly bad episode. 

Last night, we went out to a club together. We were just sitting and chatting. He had a few drink and we were going to the next place but turns out our tickets were for tomorrow. We had nowhere to go. He started berating me about how I do nothing. How this is our life without him. Just wandering the streets with no money. My phone was dead. In a way he was right. But he just kept going on and on, telling me I do nothing. I’ve never done anything even though he’s given me every opportunity. That I ruined his life because I don’t care about anything. 

He threw his phone to me and said take us somewhere. Do something. Let’s see what you can do. But I felt like if I took us home it would prove him right. And I knew he’d just keep saying all that mean stuff so I figured if he had another drink maybe it would quiet him and he would just sleep. 

That was the worst possible thing I could have done. Once we got in there it was chaos. He ordered 4 drinks at a time and chugged them all. He put all his money in the slot machine. He spent so much money on drinks. By the time we left he was belligerent. I’m surprised he didn’t get arrested. 

When I finally got him in the house I was scared I would lose him. I watched him all night. He just kept vomiting all over himself and crying. Switching between I love you to how could you do this to me. You hurt me. Why did you bring me there. I didn’t want to go. You did this to me. You should have just brought us home. I was already drunk when I got there. 

Now we’re at the hospital. He’s feeling really sick. They separated us so I don’t know how he’s doing. He doesn’t even know his phone is broken yet so he’s just up there alone with nothing. For the record he also is not a drinker. Doesn’t do drugs. Doesn’t even take Advil. 


I don’t know if I’ll have the choice but I don’t know how I’m going to fix it. He’s most upset that I’ve done nothing for myself in all the years we’ve been together. I’ve made lots of money but I haven’t saved, I didn’t go to school, I don’t have proper clothes, I have an old phone that the battery dies all the time. My cars are always maxed. I don’t have lots of friends. I make a lot of promises I can’t keep. I rely on him for motivation. Now he’s sick and tired and resentful of me because he feels like he’s given up on the things he likes to do to help me find my way and I haven’t done that. 

I don’t know what I want out of this post. Maybe for people to tell me how terrible I  because no one else in my life will. They’ll all just say I did nothing wrong like they always do. This episode has also made me realize that no one around me truly cares about me either. If they did, how could they have watched me do that to myself week after week for years and never said anything. Even when I said i was quitting my mom was like why? Not even some wine? My sister? Nobody. Only him. Only he was like what hurts so much that you keep doing this to yourself. And now it’s like I made him drink in my place. 

I hate myself so much. If I didn’t feel like I owed it to him to become a better version of myself I probably wouldn’t still be here.",brought my boyfriend to the bar when he was already drunk and now he’s in the hospital and hates me,My boyfriend is being a dick to me and I don't know what to do.
"TIFU by reading my friend his ChatGPT chats
I (20M) share a chatgpt account with a friend (35M). In the archived chats I found one talking about relationship therapy when I was looking for one of my old chats that I needed. I couldn't help myself and opened the chat. He and his girlfriend (35F) have been in a relationship for around 5/6 years already I believe. They also have a kid together. The chat mentioned they have been having some issues lately (quite often). And he had a question about therapy in the chat. They will both be going into individual therapy and possibly continue relationship therapy again later. Personally I have noticed that they have been having quite some discussions lately.

Do any of you have any advice how I could possibly bring this up without making it seem like I have snooping around through his chats.

So last night, I thought I’d surprise my girlfriend with a little whipped cream fun. I set the mood, got the can, and when she came in, I proudly revealed my masterpiece. She laughed, we got into it… and then she bolted to the bathroom. Apparently, she’s severely lactose intolerant. I guess I missed that memo.

"TIFU by pushing people away to the point of ending friendships
Continuing the constant cycle of me making a friend, getting drunk and embarrassing myself and then isolating myself and hiding from them until the friendship ends. 

Had a pretty close friend who’s seen my blackout drunk antics and our friendship has survived the first few incidents of it. Following the most recent time it happened, I did my usual routine of going AWOL for a few weeks to isolate in my apartment and drink away my sadness at another fuck up, before re-emerging and trying to salvage any friendships I’ve jeopardised.

I thought I’d come back from it again because I was expecting a full on confrontation from at least that friend and possibly others and to be cut off from there. But that didn’t happen the first time I saw her since the last incident, I managed to laugh off my antics and we made plans to hangout again. She was normal with me the first time we were hanging out since, with the only notable difference being that she didn’t want to drink and left me to drink by myself while she had tea.

But there has been a massive decline in the amount of our communicating over messages (from both sides to be fair) and when I saw her at uni today she was noticeably distant/cold with me. We sat together for around an hour and she called other people the entire time and made an excuse not to sit with me for very long. She also asked me if I was sober (this was at around 1pm and we were at university).

So I guess this more of a built up drawn out fuck up rather than one I did in its entirety today but today is the day I realised I’ve fucked up beyond being able to rescue one of my only remaining friendships.","continued the cycle of making a friend, embarrassing myself in front of them and then isolating myself until our friendship decays and I never see them again.",TIFU by pushing people away to the point of ending friendships and then isolating myself from them until the friendship ends.

So, I today I start working on moving out of my house, and I am trying to clean the place up really nice to get my security deposit back.

The toilet didn't flush on the first try, and the second flush it went down. I still smell it as I finish peeing.  I panic and run to put on my pants and frantically open my door to get outside.

"TIFU by enjoying jalapeno poppers on my man's birthday
Whelp, it's about time I had a reality check.

Today was my boyfriend's birthday, and for his birthday he wanted to have some bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers. So of course, he ate almost a whole pan and I had a few. (I usually fight him for more but, y'know, birthday rules lol)

We then had cake, ice cream, and played some video games for a few hours. All was well. We agreed to be careful and washed our hands super well, for the eventual sexy times we were both looking forward to...

While sparing you as many details as possible, uh, I did not think about what I had eaten before going down on him. It did not cross my mind at all, until after we finished up, grabbing the baby wipes when he just goes ""hey.. are you also feeling a tingle..?""

Me and my girlfriend are on a visit to Prague.

You can buy the tickets in the tram or the vehicle itself. We had been diligently buying the tickets throughout last three days. And all those travels, we didn't see any ticket checks or any controls.

But come today, we had to go from Powder tower to Mala Strana. The tram ride was just two stations away.So, we got in through the last section of the tram. The ticket boxes were in front and both of us were lazy to walk to the front and buy the tickets. We thought it is only two stations and we are there in no time. No need to buy the tickets. Well, after the first station passed, we saw some people in normal dresses starting to check people for their tickets. My girlfriend told me, they were checking tickets. We both kind of knew, we were f**ed by then. But we hoped may be we could do the last minute escape since our station was the next. But the stations were so far apart that we could not escape the control.

He came to us and asked for tickets which we had none. So, he offered us to pay 1000 Czech Krowns for each of us kind of like 40 Euros each. We had to pay it right then, making it our most expensive ride ever in terms of price paid vs distance covered ratio.

So for a bit of backstory I (F, white, teenager) live in a small working class area of inner city Dublin. My area was previously very white up until recently - very recently, as in literally five years ago you wouldn’t see anyone living here who wasn’t Irish and white. Over the past few years there have been new apartments built and plenty of Africans, South Asians, Eastern Europeans, Brazilians and more have moved in. Now, I have zero problem with this.

I felt anxious and started walking faster. The person kept following me, making me walk faster and faster until they caught up to me. She spoke and I realised she was in fact a woman. She was also not white. She explained that she needed directions. I told her where to go, then decided to apologise for walking away. Boy oh boy, did that come out wrong. I said “sorry for running away, I thought you were a man.” She didn’t say anything but I could tell I fucked up. So I tried to fix it but ended up doubling down and making it worse.

"TIFU by having a bag of bloody human teeth in my desk.
A few years back, when I had my wisdom teeth removed, they were fully grown, perfectly healthy teeth. The only reason they were removed was because my dentist was worried that there wasn't quite enough room in my mouth for them without crowding my other teeth. All four wisdom teeth were consequently yoinked, and they came out whole, no cracks, no broken pieces. As dentists do (apparently), mine asked if I wanted to keep the teeth. I said I did, and she gave them to me in a plastic sandwich bag, still bloody and fresh. When I got home, I threw the bag in the Doom Drawer of my desk and mostly forgot about it. Every now and then, while digging for something or other, I see the bag in there. All four teeth, the blood on them now dried, still in their bag. No biggie. Just a memento, right? 

Then we come to today. While I am working at my desk, my wife asks me if I have a certain size of sticky note, and I tell her to check my Doom Drawer. I think nothing of it, like a fool. Well, my wife is digging in the drawer, pulling out things as she digs deeper, and then it happens. Out of the corner of my eye, I see her freeze. I turn in my chair, and she is holding the bag of teeth. She doesn't say a word. She just quietly places the bag of teeth back in the drawer, puts everything else back on top of it, and tells me she will just cut some normal sticky notes down to size. She leaves the room. 

This happened less than twenty minutes ago, and I'm still sitting at my desk. I'm probably going to go explain to her that I am not a serial killer now. Wish me luck.","I kept my wisdom teeth when they were removed years ago. My wife, with no context, found a bag of human teeth covered in dried blood in my desk today.

"TIFU by accidentally moving my exes underwear into my current partner’s apartment
I am in the process of moving out of my old place, into my partner’s. We’ve been dating for a little over a year, and I couldn’t be happier about it. Over that year, I’ve progressively spent more time at their place, we are coparenting a dog together, and building a rad life. When we started dating, I had been single for some time and was dating around and had a couple partners (all of this was well understood and communicated). 

Anyways, in the process of moving out of my old place, I was consolidating my laundry to move into my partner’s. I definitely threw some underwear in the mix I found buried in my closet, and assumed it was her’s. 

Well, today she texted me saying she was going through the laundry and found women’s underwear that was not hers. She was very cool about it, and we have a shit ton of trust and good communication. 

It was an honest and stupid mistake, but I definitely feel like I fucked up by not having gotten rid of my ex’s underwear, and having to put my current partner through that discomfort.","Moving into current partners place and accidentally brought over my ex’s underwear, thinking it was current partners.

"TIFU by getting scammed after I read an online multimodal article
I (16M) got scammed of my grandmother’s inheritance after I invested in a “game changing” crypto because a website told me to do so.

In hindsight, here’s what I should have done instead:

S - Source
 
I should’ve checked the trustworthiness of the source such as the author. This would’ve warned me on whether his recommendation was credible. 

U - Understanding

I did not understand that the author was imposing his potentially biased opinion about the crypto onto me. I should’ve dug deeper and scanned for authorial bias

R - Reactions

I reacted too strongly after reading this article, influenced by the prospect of becoming rich and retiring in my 30s. I should’ve looked past my emotions and thought about it logically. 

F - Fact Check

"TIFU by missing a car accident
It had started raining and I was just driving home from visiting a friend. I was traveling in the right travel lane through an intersection where I had the green light, and a person on the perpendicular road was traveling down the hill and failed to stop without entering my lane.

In an attempt to avoid the driver and be in an accident, I swerved over into the left lane and onto the muddy shoulder. During this entire maneuver to avoid being in an accident, I had struck a deep hole and ended up jolting myself a little bit.

I was holding a Celsius can up to my mouth when this started and after hitting the hole, the Celsius can smashed into my tooth. I didn’t really think anything of it until I was eating hours later and 1/3 of my tooth fell off. I scheduled an emergency dentist appointment and was told that because the break was so close to the nerves, I would need a root canal and they could not cap it.

I’m still livid about the whole situation and because of financial constraints will not be able to get a root canal anytime soon. I keep wondering if I should have just let them hit me and have their insurance pay.","Avoided being involved in a car accident, broke a tooth, need a root canal with no money, should have let them hit me.",I hit a deep hole in my tooth and it broke.

Ok so first of all, I know what I did was wrong and I did wash my hands after. 
Second of all this was at a McD. Bro, licking my hands is the least of your worries.

Full story: So I’m an opener and I’ve been sleep deprived af the past week. This morning I was making a frappe and oops, I got a bit of whipped cream on my finger and not thinking, I licked it off. 
I was in front of the drive thru window. Sh*t. 

I was handed the customer’s food (coke and a sandwich) by a runner. I never directly touched his food. Still he (rightly) called me out and was surprisingly polite about it but also disgusted. Either way I apologized, but was like “f off dude”as he drove off. I was having a crappy morning. 

And yes, I washed my hands immediately after despite it being busy.

"TIFU by making a truly unintentional but highly racist comment
I (white/middle-aged/F) have been on the “blue dot” side of TikTok lately (thankfully) and recently lots of creators have taken to the platform to voice their opinions on the recent half-time show. One in particular was a younger white woman who offered her explanation of a specific moment of the show, and asked if she was spot-on or way-off. All of the comments were extremely positive and most that I read were from people of color, especially Black women. Well my ignorant self hopped in there with nothing but good intentions and said “I think you get a lifetime invitation to the cookout”. Then the replies started coming in….the first was good (I thought) “🫶😂😭”. Then the second was an eye roll from a Black woman. Then the third was simply “girl what”. All of the “likes” were from white women. That first “good” comment was from a white woman. I immediately wanted to explain but I know how that sounds. “I’m not racist!” Is the first thing a racist says to defend their racism. I truly am not, so I deleted the comment instead and have since been educated on that phrase. I previously understood the phrase’s meaning, but have since learned that I am absolutely NOT who should be saying it.

TIFU - hard. I ran out of my lovely lavender Dr Bronner’s and grabbed by husband’ peppermint instead thinking no big deal. He claims it’s very invigorating and refreshing and I figured that was the ticket since I don’t want to fall asleep after a day in the hot sun, working in my garden and yard. 

I scrubbed well with my bath pouf and enjoyed the pleasantly scented steaming rising about me. Everything was all well and good until I started to rinse. Suddenly things were tingling, tingling unpleasantly, and that very quickly gave rise to a burning sensation.

"TIFU by accidentally filing my front bottom right tooth
I have those back braces on my bottom row of my teeth. One of the resins sticking them to my tooth chipped during dinner and the sharp edge was driving me crazy since it is right against my tongue.

I remembered I had a travel nail clipper with a file on the back and thought ""I'll just sand it down. Just carefully make sure the stupid spike doesn't bother me anymore."" I knew full well about how filing your teeth was a VERY bad idea because enamel damage is no joke, but I just impulsively decided to go ahead with it. It was two light scrapes. I definitely hit something.

When I checked if the spike was gone, it was still there, so that can only mean I hit something else with the file and that something is 99% likely to have been the top of my tooth.

"TIFU on losing my virginity after eating too much
Before i explain i want to get three things out of the way. The first is that this happened years ago, not today. The other is that i have really bad anxiety (this will come into play towards the end). And third, yes i do realize i was a serious asshole in this situation and i regret every second of it. I am not proud of what im about to admit.

Okay so when i started my freshman year of college i was a virgin and never had a serious girlfriend. Since i was 18 and living on campus i thought i would try online dating, so i made a tinder account. I got a surprising amount of matches (5 is a surprising amount to me). And while i was talking with a few nothing was really going anywhere.

Then i matched with HER. (Wont give her real name but ill call her Amy)

Amy was surprisingly forward. She came off flirty right off the bat, had some common interests with me, and things were going great. I asked if she wanted to meet in person and then go on a date. She agreed to meet me in person, but she didnt want it to be a date. She wanted it to be that night.. at her place.. just the two of us. At the time i thought it was too good to be true and that there was no way she was suggesting what i thought she was. So i asked her ""What will we do? Like watch a movie? Play video games or something?"".

Sure enough she WAS suggesting what i thought she was, and told me direct what she wanted. I, being the horny dumbass that i was, agreed without a thought. She told me to come to her place later that night. It was around 10am (it was before my classes of the day) that we were texting so i still had a lot of stuff to do, but i agreed.

Of course, throughout classes, i could not focus AT ALL. All i could think was ""Holy shit holy shit holy shit horny horny horny horny"" while internally doing the ""im going to do it"" dance from that 70's show. Now as excited as i was i was also extremely nervous. And when i nervous i eat. A lot. So when i went to the university cafeteria i gorged myself on as much food as i could. I figured that it would give me enough energy for the physical activity i had planned for tonight. And for some reason my dumb ass decided to eat a big ass burrito filled with the spiciest shit they had.

That was a fucking mistake.

Moving on i went through classes and let Amy know that i could come over at any time. She said 11pm. That gave me about 4 hours to kill so i prepared myself. I first got out what i established as my ""date clothes"", which was essentially a black V neck and a pair of dark jeans. Took a shower and made sure to wash every inch of my body with extreme prejudice. After i got out i made sure to shave my junk (Porn was my idea of sex at the time). I then went to the store to buy four 3-packs of condoms. The reason i bought too many was two fold. For starters i thought different kinds of condoms must meant different sizes, and i didnt know what my ""condom size"" would be. The other reason is because in porn guys would always be able to get off about 3-6 times (if not more), so i thought that must be what would happen to me and i wanted to be prepared. Such a sad, naive fool i was...

Then it was time.

When i got to her place i knocked on the door As soon as she answered and i saw her standing there, instantly my dick went ""ATTEN-SHUN!"". My mouth wasnt cooporative, and made an assortment of random syllables that could probably be confused with words if you werent paying attention. Surprisingly she just giggled and invited me in.

Amy already knew i was a virgin (we talked about it before she invited me), so she asked if i was nervous. I said a little. She said not to worry... before pushing me back against the door, pressing herself against me, and next thing i knew we were making out hot and heavy.

All nervousness i had leading up to that vanished. We stripped while making out on the way to her bedroom to the point where if anyone walked into the apartment they would just see a trail of men and women's clothing leading throughout the apartment.

Once we got in there we started the deed (i will spare the graphic details). It was good and fun for the first few minutes..

Then i felt a rumble and heat come to my lower intestines. The kind to let me know SOMETHING is about to leave my body.. and NOT the stuff i wanted to come out of me during that time. I thought maybe i could power through, but with each pelvic thrust i felt less and less from the front and more and MORE from the back.

I stopped and said ""Uhh.. i hate to do this.. but wheres your bathroom?""

She turned around to look at me, raised an eyebrow and said ""Seriously? You have to go NOW?""

I said i was sorry and it will just take a minute. She rolled her eyes and said out her room, first door on the left in the hall. I left the room and made my way to the bathroom (made sure to close BOTH doors). I barely made it to the toilet in time.

Then the impact struck..

I fucking DESTROYED that toilet. Ever seen the Finch bathroom stall scene from American Pie? If not, look it up. That is an accurate representation of what my life was in those moments. All four states of matter left me in that moment, and there was so much im still not sure how its possible.

25 minutes later i wiped (using the last of her roll of toilet paper) and stood up on shaky legs. I, being a man, of course had to turn around to check out how i did. So i turned around to see the damage.

What i saw was so bad that i couldnt even be impressed at my performance. The pile was so large it rose ABOVE the water. I tried to flush to get rid of it.. but sure enough Mount Shit Peak did not budge at all. The only thing that happened was that the water rose up and up, stopping just below the rim of the toilet bowl. It was too big to flush. I then had a horrible realization that made panic start to set in..

I have just ""Dumb and Dumber""'d myself

With each minute i was panicing more and more. I needed a plunger. I looked around the bathroom and couldnt find one anywhere. Which led me to the conclusion that if one was here, it must be in the living room somewhere. Being as quiet as i could i opened the door and went to the living room and searched EVERYWHERE. I coudlnt find one. Not in any cabinet or closet. Not finding anything i went back to seek refuge in the bathroom.

I then started pacing around the bathroom shaking in fear. I didnt know what to do. I thought maybe for a moment i could just push it with my hands, but as i was judging the size of the mountain i came to a conclusion... Even with a plunger nothing could make that thing fit. No it would need to be removed manually. Something which was way too gross to do. I was growing more and more scared. I didnt know what to do.

I try to be a gentleman and a responsible person. I am well aware that the right thing to do would have been to bite the bullet. To walk into her room and let her know the absolute mess i have created. But in that moment i was so panicky that i couldnt. So.. my brain came to a different solution. One that would fix the situation for me..

Key word: ""for me""

My mind turned off and panik took the wheel. I yanked the bathroom door open and ran down the hall (in the opposite direction of the bedroom), making sure to pick up my clothes and shoes as i go. I was able to get my underwear and my pants partially on by the time i reached her apartment door, in which i opened and closed behind me. Once i was out of the apartment i shoved my feet into my shoes and ran, not even bothering to put my shirt on. When i finally got to my car and got it started i drove away, my tires almost screeching with how hard i slammed on the gas. Without wasting a second i got my phone out and blocked her on tinder.

Later that night i went to my roommates i shared my dorm with and confided with them. I was looking for advice and comfort. Did i get that? Nope. I got laughter and mockery that lasted all four years of college and even the past 3 years SINCE college. To this day they still tell this story to anyone who will listen.

Assholes

As for Amy.. we never exchanged phone numbers and she didnt go to my unviersity, and the student population is so large that trying to find me would be like a needle in a haystack. So i have never seen or heard from her since. To my knowledge she is still in her bathroom trying to get rid of the (admittedly) impressive dump i left.

As for me? I was so guilt-ridden that i didnt get laid again until i got a girlfriend in my senior year. After what happened the first time it was probably for the best.",I matched with a girl on tinder my freshman year of college. Ate a lot of spicy food that day because i eat when im nervous.

"TIFU by telling my therapist her late grandpa’s name is ugly
I just started therapy this month and it has been great, she is nice and sweet and listens to me with a lot of care. I just got out of a relationship so the first sessions have been all about me crying a lot and talking about it. But that’s not what happened last session.

We were talking about family and how my home life is, so I told her about my cats — which are my babies that I love a lot, and I told her that my male cat name is Eugene. I know it’s unusual but me and my sister had this idea to choose for an ugly name when we got another cat, so we went with this one, also giving him a last name (De LaMancha) just for funsies.

My therapist then asked how I came up with that name and I told her that I liked ugly names for cats and she smiled and told me that it’s her beloved late grandpa’s name. Oh well, it was awkward and I’m sure she thought nothing of it but yea, that’s a cool post at least.",TIFU by telling my therapist that I named my cat an ugly name that happens to be the same name as her late grandpa’s.,I told my therapist that my cat’s name is Eugene and she thought nothing of it.

Tonight when my partner and I came home from food shopping, my partner was watching a YouTube video he had found via Reddit about horses. As I was packing the fridge, I was only half listening while he was lamenting how horribly the horses were being treated.

So what does my dumb ass do? Decides to watch the video and then go on an internet deep dive on what ""Big Lick"" is (also called soring).

Not only as someone who has been around horses and owned horses for half my life do I find this deeply horrifying, but I cannot for the life of me understand how someone can own a horse and basically purposefully lame it, also shortening its life, and then justify it as a sport and say that there is no harm being done to these animals.

I think I worried my partner as the video genuinely made me cry, watching these horses be paraded around while people are laughing and cheering, and they are just trying to stay off their feet which are in pain.

Absolutely horrifying. Then I learn that the Tennessee senator is against the recent laws trying to end the sport and place harsher punishments. Not only is he a big supporter of animal abuse, so are Tennessee animal researchers who argue apparently there is no scientific basis or concerns for the laws being changed.
