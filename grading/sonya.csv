"TIFU by tinkering with a running System for aesthetics alone
So, I recently built a new PC. 7800x3D, 4080S, high grade components all chosen with aesthetics in mind. If I spend 3 grand on a PC, might as well make it look good. But my mind goblin wasn't happy with the RAM, it wasn't quite fitting the vibe of the rest of my components. So, instead of replacing the kit, since I got it heavily discounted, I ordered aftermarket heat spreaders to exchange them with the original ones.

When they arrived today, I immediately went to work. I started prying the heat spreader of the first module. I should say, that the heat spreaders are glued to the memory modules. At some point, I thought that the way I was bending the PCB to pry it off can't be good, and something might give that shouldn't. So I continued more carefully.

For the second stick, I didn't even pry, I inserted a plastic separation tool at the edge, slowly cutting the glue between the memory modules and the heat spreader. When I was done I installed the aftermarket ones. (they don't use glue, but thermal pads and a few screws)

Aesthetic, on point! But the system... wouldn't boot. I thought about the flex of the first memory stick. I pulled it out, to see if it would boot just with the second one, that I was more careful with... but no, again just the DRAM debug light.

I swapped the sticks.. Boom, boot. No issue.. That didn't make any sense? I had been cautious with the second one, there was no flex... so why does the first one boot, and the second one doesn't?

It took me some more trial and error, but with my second visual inspection of the memory stick, I found it... a memory module had cracked, just at the edge, where I started to push the plastic separator in between the modules and the heat spreader.

I fucked up by tinkering with my running system, and by getting scared about bending it too much, and not allowing myself to bend it at all on the second one. As evidenced by the first one working, that much flex was ok. And at least a little was necessary to not crack a module when pushing in the separator.

really fast way to flush 100€ down the drain. Time to buy ram that fits my aesthetic better and not get lured by a discount. Not doing that again. q.q",I got RAM heat spreaders to exchange on a RAM kit I recently bought just for aesthetics for my new PC.

"TIFU By finding my bfs secret Reddit (Update)
So this is kinda of an update post about a TIFU i posted earlier today and deleted.

To summarize I F(27) fucked up by opening my bfs M (26) Reddit. We were hanging out at our friend’s place and he asked me to check if a friend had responded to a message. 

We have been together for 4 years now, living together for 3, we both wfh so we quite literally see each other everyday, know everything about each other and have no restrictions on seeing each others phones.

After checking the message I got onto his TikTok and got bored so switched over to Reddit where he generally has good memes.

Instead I was greeted with a Reddit account containing a lot of raunchy porn (Lots of Of threads and girls that actually kinda look like me). I was kind of flabbergasted and started laughing when he asked what’s up.

I’m not in the habit of lying so I tried telling him we could discuss it later (because our friend was there) he insisted a couple of times so I just blurted out, I saw your Reddit and showed him.

Here is where I may have Fucked Up: he immediately went defensive and started saying it wasn’t his, he doesn’t remember having that and switched over to his regular account. I immediately went into Don’t BS Me I’m not stupid mode, and instead of changing topic, pushed back against him “No this is clearly all stuff you like and you even commented on this post about the area we live in, not long ago” he KEPT pushing back a couple of times and I started reading the communities he was in out loud (which had not so lovely names) saying “This is clearly what your into, stop lying it’s ok” and laughing.

Our friend was very chill, he laughed and made the best of it, not making it awkward. I made a Reddit post about it because I felt a bit insecure about it in the moment. And I was reassured (thanks).

This is where the update part comes in:
We went and had an entire day with our friends and got home not so long ago, he sat down and told me: 

“I lied about it not being mine, I felt deeply embarrassed and terrible and didn’t want our friend to know that about me, I don’t think I’ll be able to see him in a while without feeling shame, I also felt embarrassed by you finding it, so I deleted all of it, after that I realized I, that was it, I have nothing for myself and you and I share absolutely everything, I don’t have a space that is only mine, (we live in a small apartment) we work together side by side, we have friends together, everything we do is together, nothing is just mine. And I realized I don’t want that. I don’t want to break up, I love you, but I don’t want that for me.”

And went to the gym. 

I honestly don’t know what to say or do, I think he’s right? It’s kinda sad that I accidentally stumbled upon that and destroyed his last bit of privacy. Any thoughts?",TIFU by uncovering my bfs secret Reddit account and exposing him to our friend and destroying his last bit of privacy,I opened my bfs M (26) Reddit and found a lot of porn on there.

TIFU for not drinking enough water for years,"I thought I was just unhealthy, but I was severely dehydrated. 

I wouldn’t start drinking water until after my energy drink, around 1pm. Some days, I would forget to drink water altogether. I had never really recognized thirst, except during intense drinking exercise or hot weather. Nobody in my immediate family drinks water. They drink tea or soda or alcohol, but no straight-up water. So, I thought I was fine, I was the most hydrated person I knew, after all. I’m also bulimic—purging, laxatives, exercise, restriction, the whole nine yards, which fucked me over so much worse. I always had health issues, especially with my heart, but I chalked it up to bulimia.

A few months ago, I went in for a strep test. The nurse was getting my vitals. They wanted a urine sample for a pregnancy test to see which antibiotics to prescribe, but I couldn’t provide one after 3 bottles of water. My heart rate literally went from 40 to 140 in seconds WHILE I WAS SEATED. They did my orthostatic vitals (laying, sitting, standing) and it was clear that I was dehydrated. I had to be rolled out in a wheelchair to go to the ER to get an IV. I felt much better after the IV, but I figured it was the pain meds they gave me for strep. 

More recently, I returned for my check up. They took my vitals again, had to do orthostatic, and gave me another IV. I felt amazing afterwards. I couldn’t remember ever feeling that alert and energized. I didn’t know you weren’t supposed to feel your heartbeat all of the time. I didn’t have any afterimages, and I wasn’t seeing faint stars in my vision. The strangest part was, I didn’t feel anything when I was sitting down or standing up. I couldn’t remember ever feeling so normal.

So, I made hydration a priority. I stocked up on HydraLyte, cut back on caffeine, am receiving treatment for bulimia, and set reminders to drink water. No more dry eyes or skin, better BMs, and I have a lot more color in my face. I can’t believe I lived like that for so long, especially with the fatigue and brain fog. I really hope it doesn’t have any long-term consequences. I wish I had known so much earlier!!!",Drink enough water.,Drink water,not drinking enough water for years.
"TIFU by not wearing sunscreen and getting a rare nerve reaction called “hell’s itch” and having the worst 30 hours of my life.
First off before anyone reads my story, i just want to say, Hells itch is NOT a normal sunburn itch. It’s some sort of nerve reaction. For those who think i am exaggerating how debilitating this is, please go over to r/HellsItch and read some user testimonials. Heres one from two days ago:


> “I've experienced acute heroin withdrawal with no medication (cold turkey), as well as a kidney stone that was too big to treat ultrasonically, Those were like a stubbed toe compared to this”




Anyway heres the TIFU. Several years ago i went to the beach for a few hours and like an idiot didn’t put sunscreen on.
I ended up getting a sunburn on my upper body. 

The next evening i was chilling on the couch watching tv after taking a shower when i suddenly felt a slight tickle on my chest. Not really thinking much of it i just brushed my hand across my chest thinking it was a hair or something. About a minute later the feeling came back suddenly and sharply, this time though it was more tingly and itchy.


I scratched the itch, thinking it’s just the sunburn itching and it went away. Probably about 10 seconds later it came back fiercely. The tingly itch was so strong my hand literally automatically jolted up to my chest to scratch it, like my brain forced it too. I was like huh? 


This didn’t feel like a normal sunburn itch, It felt deep in my skin. Have you ever got a random itch on the bottom of your foot or palm of your hand that feels like its a inch under your skin and you cant seem to scratch it? Thats what it felt like. I examined myself with a flashlight thinking a bug or something bit me, but nothing was there.


Within then next few minutes this tiny spot on my chest had started spreading to my entire chest and shoulders. It would itch FIERCELY and felt like ants with razorblades as feet were under my skin. At this point i started to panic and went to go put some aloe on it hoping to sooth it. BIG FUCKING MISTAKE. This amplified the itch twofold and significantly increased the pain. i was on the verge of tears. None of this made any sense. Aloe is supposed to help sunburns and sooth them.


By this time it had been maybe ten minutes since this started and little did i know a journey to the depths of hell was just beginning. I frantically started googling things like “extremely itchy sun burn how to relieve” and quickly discovered something called “Hell’s itch” or “suicide itch”. 


I did some reading and found out that this is not a typical sunburn itch it is something completely different and SIGNIFICANTLY worse. It occurs about 48 hours after a sunburn and the itch usually begins after taking a shower. Things that typically help relieve symptoms of a sunburn such as aloe or cream do the polar opposite and make the symptoms much worse, while things that normally make a sunburn hurt WORSE such as a hot shower HELP relieve the itch.



So here i was, standing in a BOILING hot shower, and it was helping. Once the hot water ran out i got out and started absolutely tweaking. The itch was so fucking bad that my brain literally forced my arms to reach up to scratch it, it was uncontrollably at this point and i was just pacing around tweaking out and itching. I could barely stand it was so bad.


This went on all night and all next day until the following morning. i didn’t sleep at all. I had to camp out on the couch so i wouldn’t keep my fiance up all night too because i literally could not sit still and was just crying and itching from the pain. It was so bad that i would rather relive breaking both of my legs during an accident i had as a teenager then deal with this hell on earth ever again.","Got a rare reaction to sunburn that caused a painful uncontrollable itching sensation that incapacitated me, it was so bad that it felt like molten lava fire ants under my skin for almost two days.

"TIFU by getting my own insurance
I've been on my parents insurance since I was 16, now 20. It was going fine, they paid for it and I put my money towards my car. Today, my car is paid off and I have no tickets, no accidents, and tag is always up to date. We'll, recently (two days ago) my parents insurance needed to be renewed, and this year/month I needed to pay $200, I was appalled and told them to take me off their insurance because if 5 people needed to pay $200 each than the insurance was too expensive (for 5 cars it wasnt).

Well, I've been looking for insurance ever since, the lowest rate I could find was $475, my car is 10 years old, it's paid off, and I live 10mins from the city in the middle of know where! What the heck! I checked the quotes from every auto insurer there was. From Progressive to All State, from the Gecko to the General. All of them was at or above $300 a month, but don't worry! If I give them $1600 twice a year then it's technically a discount :D forget that rent in my area is $1200 plus utilities, forget that most homes in my area are around $200,000 so a mortgage with home owners insurance would be cheaper! Just don't think! Because you have to pay it!

And guess what? Because my parents took me off their plan their rates went down, and if they add me their rates would go up higher than it was before :D!

"TIFU by accidentally ripping a CPU out of it's socket
By TIFU, I mean closer to 20 years ago.

Inspired by [https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1jz7hbt/tifu\_by\_tinkering\_with\_a\_running\_system\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1jz7hbt/tifu_by_tinkering_with_a_running_system_for/) .

I was the family/friend tech guy who built and worked on their computers.  I remember when a few years after I built my step-nephew's (same age) first custom desktop, it needed Windows reinstalled.  I did so, and at the same time, I re-arranged all the wiring to make it all nice and neat in the case.

He then wanted any fans that didn't already, to have blue LEDs, among them the CPU cooler - which, for whatever reason, wasn't able to simply have the existing cooler's fan replaced (maybe it was a weird size).  We went to Micro Center, picked up what we need, but on the way to the checkout, he sees a nice transparent (and semi-static) case, and it's cheap.  He's got to have it.

So I undid all the work I had done in his old desktop case, worked with him to rebuild the computer in the new case, which sucked, went to change the CPU cooler, but I didn't let the CPU warm up enough by leaving the computer on for a little while, and we ripped the CPU (with the socket still attached) out of its socket.  It would've been AMD 754-pin ""Socket 754"".  It sounded terrible when it came out.

The desktop no longer worked once we re-inserted the CPU onto the motherboard with its new blue LED cooler fan attached, so I found a newer, reasonably priced motherboard for him to buy that was still compatible with his now old CPU and RAM.

By the way, I'm more of a function over form kind of guy myself, I care about how my computer works, not how it looks other than keeping dust out.","- Rebuilt step-nephew's desktop, didn't discourage them from making more work for us both by buying unnecessary computer components, ended up doing even much more than we thought we would.",TIFU by accidentally ripping a CPU out of its socket.,TIFU by ripping a CPU out of its socket.,TIFU by ripping a CPU out of it's socket.

"TIFU By Renaming someone’s dog
Today I fucked up by renaming somebody’s dog. So I was at a celebration of life and a few family members I had never met were there. These people brought their dog, I didn’t know whose dog he was. I was swimming as the celebration of life was at a lake, and the dog comes up to me. He didn’t have a name on his collar, so I looked at him and decided he looked like a Paulo (pow-lo), so I started calling him Paulo. I did this for the three day celebration until one of the owners saw what I was doing and asked why I was calling him Paulo. I said no one told me his name and he looks like a Paulo. They then told me his name was Benjamin. I said sorry he had been listening to Paulo so I just went with it. They asked what I meant so I walked away and called for him using Paulo, he ran right over and sat down. They then tried to call him using Benjamin, he didn’t move. They tried again, nothing. Twice more they tried nothing. Then they said Paulo and he ran right over. They gave him a middle name of Paulo that day. I’ll probably never see them again but I’ll forever know their dog is now Benjamin Paulo because of me.

Mini Update: I was just informed he was a rescue and they changed his name to Benjamin when they got him. Maybe his name was Paulo all along","At a celebration of life there was a dog I didn’t know, couldn’t find his name called him Paulo.

"TIFU getting drunk and puking inside my backpack
Oh boy… Welcoming party when I started college and teenage me goes drinking with the intention of getting wasted like never before. I drank sooooo much that at the end I was seeing double and my newly made friends had to drag-walk me to the metro station. 

We got into the train and took out places trying to keep it cool. The sun was already coming out and the wagon was full with people going to work. Then it happened: I began to feel like getting sick. Maybe it was the train movements that made me dizzy. I don’t know… Embarrassed to make a mess, drunk me assumed the inside of my backpack was the least bad place to puke. I proceeded to unzip it and let flow a waterfall of what felt like a full gallon of puke. 

Even though I was so drunk, I still remember the look of terror, pity, and disgust of the woman in front of me every time I raised my head to take a break before going at it again. 

Finally, I got rid of all my alcohol (and the chips, and a hamburger, and my vegetables… I think I even puked my breakfast!). I was feeling so much relief - then remembered my laptop and notebooks were inside the backpack. I got the laptop and notebooks out and they a dripping vomit. In the process, I smeared puke all over the sit. My friend was sitting on my side and I drop them on his lap without even asking, covering him in vomit as well. 

The notebooks were of no use after that, but the laptop somehow survived. 

Worst of all, the backpack turn out not to be water proof and vomit began leaking through the bottom, and I was still so brainlessly drunk that I didn’t feel it. So I was soaked in my own vomit by the time I got off the train. I was wearing a white summer dress that well… was never white anymore.

"TIFU Missed opportunity to talk to a girl who was eyeing me
Yesterday I was traveling back home from an event and stopped to get gas about an hour away from where I live. When I pull up to the gas pump on the other side is a very attractive girl my age (24), my type and everything. Now I don't talk to random girl like ever so I wasn't going to say anything and just go about my business of getting gas and going home.

However, whenever I glanced over at her she would make eye contact for a bit, until I instinctively dart my eyes away. At that point I'm thinking she is just noticing when I glanced over and that's all. But this happened a couple more times while I'm leaning on my car waiting. I noticed she was done pumping and now she's just sitting in her car and she kept looking over at me. And she didn't starting driving away until got in the car and left. 

Now I'm scared I missed an opportunity like she was waiting for me to say something to her. Unless my ability to read body language is completely wrong... The worst part is I knew what she was doing while I was still there and had the chance to say something, but I'm so petrified in situations like that with an attractive girl. Then afterwards driving home, mad I didn't take my chance afterwards. I know I'm never going to see her ever again and who knows what could have happened if I just said hi and maybe gave her my number.

That's all. Just wanting to share and maybe making this post will not let me forget this feeling and hopefully help next time I'm in a situation like this to just say something.",- didn't say anything to a girl who I think was giving me all the signs to approach her.,"Missed opportunity to talk to attractive girl, scared I didn't take my chance.",Missed opportunity to talk to attractive girl who was eyeing me while I was waiting at the gas pump.,TIFU Missed opportunity to talk to a girl who was eyeing me.
"TIFU by not reading the instructions to my iced coffee
Obligatory “this was a couple of years ago”. I got a bottle of iced coffee at the store, just grabbed whatever on the shelf and didn’t think too much about it. I poured it into my 24 oz cup with a little ice, a lot of sugar, and no milk because that’s how I like my coffee. Later that evening I thought I was actually dying. My heart was going a 100 mph and I was dizzy with a throbbing headache. I was a poor college kid at the time so there was no way I was paying for the ER so I tried sleeping it off and it worked! The next day I went to make another cup of iced coffee and was looking at the label and noticed that it was a concentrate. You were supposed to add like a tablespoon to 12 ounces of water. I drank like 20 ounces straight. It’s a good thing my caffeine tolerance was so high or I probably would have had a heart attack.
