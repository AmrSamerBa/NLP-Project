"TIFU at work. Afraid of getting robbed.
Burner account for obvious reasons.

Started working as a cashier recently. Today a man and his wife come to the store. They grab some things.

They don't speak english, but I get to half-understand them. He pays and when I'm giving him the change he asks for ""an older bill"" because he ""collects them in his country"". I start to get nervous because he insists, I say no a few times but he is there staring at me and keeps asking. I'm so social anxious I was getting red and sweating so I was fucking blocked and ended showing him a lot of bills I had in my cash register. Like 500$. I know. I'm so fucking dumb, what was I thinking? I was so numb.

Then he finally gets angry because I don't give him anything and leaves the store.

Now I'm so fucking scared. This was a few hours ago. What if he was checking how much money was in the cash register to rob later? My heart is fucking racing right now and I can't think properly. I can't believe how am I so dumb.

I thought about calling the police but I don't know if I'm just paranoid, also it could cost me my job (which I would understand). Maybe he just wanted to scam me or something, but I'm terrified of getting robbed now.

Only two coworkers who were there know about this. They told he probably just wanted to scam us but that I really fucked up.",Showed a lot of money in front someone suspicious at work.,"Man tried to rob me, I showed him a lot of bills I had in my cash register.","Man tried to rob my store, I was so social anxious I ended up showing him a lot of bills I had in my cash register.",I fucked up a man and his wife.

"TIFU but was it on me?
Hey guys, Just recently lost a lot of weight and have started to go the clubs and have been getting a lot of attention from girls now who I find very attractive . So this last weekend I went out with some boys after a big college party and the bars were packed. Well waiting in line I start talking to this girl and we immediately hit it off. She ends up staying with me the entire night and ending up wanting to come home with me after her friends decided to leave after she told them she wanted to stay. Let me start by saying after she told me she wanted to come back to mine she said she didn’t want to have sex, and we had been talking about how we both went to church and were Christian (I think she was being genuine as she asked my brother to and her sister has “Jesus is king” in her bio (I was honest about how struggle with being always faithful) So we get back to my place and pretty much immediately go into my bed bed and start making out and she gets on top of my and starting riding with but with her shirt and underwear still on. So this pretty much goes on the whole night with her on top of me well I finger her and she like dry humps me and this happened the entire night In between us sleeping from like 2:30am to 10am and then I drove her home. I am a virgin and she isn’t but she was under the impression I wasn’t a virgin and she had guessed I had like 8 bodies I then told her I had 2 and she thought I was lying and it was way more. I just can’t believe a women would do all of this but not give me any sort of play (no sex, bj or hj) it got to the point where I told her I wanted to fuck her but she still said no and I respected her boundaries and just continued on with what we were doing. I asked her numerous times if she wanted to leave my house throughout the night to be nice and see if she was still comfortable but she kept wanting to stay at mine until I took her home. I’m just wondering if I missed a point to escalate it to sex but at the same time I don’t know what more I could have done. And unfortunately now she is seemingly ghosting me after texting me the day after. Like did I genuinely not escalate enough or did she really just want to have sex? She seemed really into it and was enjoying it and we had a lot of fun and laughs and talked a lot in between other things.",did I get played and not escalate enough?,"Went out with some guys, hit it off with a girl, she wants to come home with me after her friends decided to leave after she told them she wanted to stay with me.

"TIFU by accidentally switching book bags and exposing my “sexual self-improvement” phase to my boss
So during my lunch break today, I decided to hit up a bookstore.

Trying to be better, learn more about myself, you know?

Picked up two books: one about sexual development and intimacy, the other about confidence in relationships.

All educational but let’s just say the covers don’t hold back.



Anyway, fast-forward to me back at the office, post-lunch.

Boss calls me into a quick meeting. I bring my stuff, drop my bag next to me.

We’re talking about quarterly reports or whatever.



At some point, I reach into what I think is my bag to grab a notebook.

Instead, I pull out “Awaken Your Inner Orgasm” and “The Sensual Brain”... in front of my very serious, very senior manager.



We both paused.

Time stopped.

Even the fluorescent lights flickered in shame.



Turns out I’d accidentally grabbed someone else’s book bag at the shop.

Mine had been switched and now I was not only the sexual wellness guy, but also the lunchtime kink reader.



Manager didn’t say anything.

Just raised one eyebrow like he’d unlocked a hidden HR side quest.

I mumbled something about “wrong bag, not mine, educational purposes???”

It didn’t help.

"TIFU by not throwing away trash
Okay so, I’m 19 y/o male and I still live with my parents, and a couple months ago I bought a dildo for some me time. (Which I don’t use or do often). And today I went to work and left my room a little messy, not alot just some clothes on the floor and a trash bag laying around. After work, I come back and notice my whole room is cleaned and rearranged. I didn’t think much of it and then a deep realization hit and sudden panic. I zip into my closet to see that it’s fully rearranged. And yep before you ask, I  like a dumb ass I forgot to throw away my packaging for the dildo, so it’s just in its packaging box in my closet sitting in its Amazon box and I have no clue if my parents looked inside and honestly I’m embarrassed to say something.",I forgot to clean my messy room and accidentally revealed my fun time activities to my parents,I forgot to throw away my dildo and it’s sitting in its packaging box in my closet.,"Forgot to throw away packaging for a dildo, so it's sitting in my closet and I have no clue if my parents saw it.",I forgot to throw away a dildo in my closet and I have no clue if my parents looked inside.
"TIFU by telling a pregnant woman she should drink ginger tea
So a couple of weeks ago I reunited with some family and friends, just a chill weekend night out. One of my family members (let’s call her Emma), decided to announce her pregnancy… and the table didn’t react well. Some factors to consider: 

She decided to quit her job now so her body would have time to rest and form a baby, her husband makes around 27.000€ per year. Also, days before they also got into debt to buy an used car. 

On top that, they had been getting more and more into church which had caused some incidents within our group of friends because they are prioritizing the church a lot. There is also a cultural expectation that you need to support your family financially if you make more money than them. 

Perfect storm for a really awkward moment. 

So, her brother is losing his shit because he needs to support a child now, her sister-in-law is questioning her about getting a new job and medical stuff, others are asking if it was planned or an accident… the congratulations were left in the background. 

So, tensions are high, Emma is on the verge of tears after some stiff hugs and congrats. Other people and I try to salvage the situation by saying some supportive stuff like “I’m sure everything will work out!”, “let us know if you need help!”, etc. 

I, in my all time brilliantness, try to google remedies for morning sickness, since she mentioned how much of a hard time she was having with it. One cure comes up from the depths of google: Ginger tea!

“Hahaha” I think, “she would surely appreciate it! This will help defuse the tension!” 

I tell her with a smile “Why don’t you drink some ginger tea tomorrow? It will surely make you feel better”. And with that, another awkward silence falls over the table and I seal my fate as the Ginger Woman for the next couple of weeks. 

Apparently, as Emma and other older women informed me, ginger is an abortive. I was kind-of implying she should yeet the baby and save us all the trouble. Emma didn’t react well, she got more upset and emotional.

Doctor Google failed me once again. 

At least, it wasn’t a complete fuckup? It shifted some of the tension of the table into mocking my ignorant faux-pass (Excuse me! Being a woman doesn’t include some inherent knowledge about abortive ingredients!). Emma started crying and the reunion ended a bit later. 

Things are better now in the family, but I’m now know as the Woman Who Offers Abortives to Pregnant Woman (because my family loves to poke fun of people). Even now weeks laters, Emma mentions the ginger incident each time we see each other, and honestly, she says it with a bit of a dig each time, and I don’t wish to correct her because I feel it will cause more conflict and awkwardness.","A family member got pregnant, the family didn’t take it well. I googled how to help her with the morning sickness, and offered to buy her ginger tea, which she thinks is an abortive, she did not like that and got upset. I’m now the Ginger Woman. 

So, yeah, don’t offer medical advice from google.","Told pregnant woman she should drink ginger tea, she didn’t react well.","Told a pregnant woman she should drink ginger tea to help with morning sickness, turns out it is an abortive.",a pregnant woman told me she should drink ginger tea and save us all the trouble.

"TIFU by making margaritas
So yesterday, enjoying a beautiful afternoon, seemed like the perfect day to make have some margaritas with the neighbors.  Had a giant bag of limes and i cut and juiced all of them so we could have a couple of pitchers at the ready for the night.  Everything goes great, drinks are drank, jokes are told, food is cooked... pretty normal friday

Until i wake up today and my hands itch and are severely purple/brown and discolored.  

After some serious time with dr. Google, and verification with an actual doctor i learned that lime juice (other citrus and bergamot and ithers) have photoreactive compounds.  So if you make a shit ton of margaritas then hang out in the sun for hours, this reaction can cause phytophotodermatitis.  Now may hands will look super weird for weeks. Sweet.

"TIFU by wanting to smoke a joint on my 3rd story patio
Ive been feeling like shit lately living an unhealthy drug/alcohol heavy sedentary lifestyle for what seems like way too long, so this week i decided i wanted to go atleast a week of living a much healthier lifestyle and hope i can feel better/force some healthier habits on me. I decided to give up smoking pot, drinking, and eating meat for the most part and make an active attempt to do 30 mins of cardio and calisthenics plus eating an extremely lighter diet consisting of mostly fruits, vegetables, fish, starches, grain, and dairy. So basically cutting out meat and junk food. I only drink soda/juice when i drink alcohol so switching to only water hasnt been an issue at all. 

After a few days of this i decided to reward myself with a smoke before bed. The main reason i smoke pot is to help me sleep because of hard insomnia so the last few nights of trying to sleep have lasted 1-2 hours. Pot doesnt always help, but it helps more than sleeping pills, anti-anxiety meds, melatonin, stretching, different positions, etc. Normally id use my bong and a sploof inside but its extremely nice outside and i have a gorgeous view of forest area right outside my balcony so i decided to treat myself with a nice sit outside and a joint. No biggie. 

On the top floor and being directly at the end building with no view of the street/parking lot has its perks since nobody can see my entire balcony unless they go in the buildings backyard and come basically to the end and id hear/see them long before they see me. So smoking has never been an issue for me on my patio. (Not legal here)

Well its extremely nice but decently windy today so lighting my joint was a bit of a nuisance but i handled it. After a few hits the wind took it out and as i was lighting it again, a gust pushed the joint right out of my hands inbetween the cracks of my patio floor and fell directly into my neighbor-below-me's very barren plant garden. I just wanted to relax and reward myself 😭 

Not wanting to be a shitty neighbor and also possibly get in trouble or get my neighbor into something, i knew i had to get it out, BUT HOW like I cant just monkey my way down there and i know my neighbor isnt even home to go to her door and tell her about the fuck up. So i have the bright idea to jerry-rig a contraption to get the joint from the plant bed a solid 10+ feet underneath my patio.

My first attempt was a cat fishing rod i have that i pinned to a ladle i have (its a dinosaur 🦕) and try to toss it over the side and scoop it out. I laid flat on my wooden floor and tossed it over the side and guided it with my arm dangling over the side. It did not feel great with the wood scratching the inside of my elbow but I was able to reach it! However , no dice. The joint wouldn't get in and it seemed to push it down into the dirt more than anything.

My second attempt involved using the cat fishing pole and an ashtray! Hoping since it was more level it would scoop in easier. As i was doing this, i noticed a lady down below in the backyard area walking her dog but i DONT think she noticed my crazy ass lol. I did go inside for a bit.  Unfortunately, still nothing when i went back. I got close, but it never landed. Im a solid 30 mins in.

My next thought was to go through the slits Inbetween the wood. I taped a bunch of colored pencils end to end and put two sewing needles at the end and hoped to stab it and pull it through but there wasnt a single area I could fit the pencils through and angle it correctly. 

Has to be about an hour in. Im miserable. I just dont wanna be a dick and leave it or get heat for it, so i decide to hit the jimmy neutron and brainstorm. 

I GOT IT. The issue with the pencils was thickness but the idea was right. I needed a way to stab it from 10+ feet out, but it had to be thin enough to fit through the slits of the patio floor. I have a fuck ton of bulk tcg cards. The plan was to tape .5 centimeter thick stacks end to end that were thin enough to fit through the crack, but stable enough to push sewing needles into the joint ontop of dirt and pull it back up to me. 

After about 1:30 of effort, i finally managed  to tape all of the cards end to end in a 12ish foot card snake with sewing needle fangs at the end. And of COURSE my luck would be that a wasp is guarding my patio railing. I swear i just cant win today. But after checking to make sure my neighbor was still gone and donning a hoodie, i braved the outdoors and remained focused. I looked down to see where the joint was and where i needed to drop the cards, and after a few attempts, i lined it up! I slide it down and wait for a gust of wind to blow the cards over the side of the garden container so it can be inside of the walls. After a few minutes of stabbing around, i nailed it! Slowly I pull each scale of the card snake up one by one until the joint is just at the edge of the underneath the wooden floor boards. Its spinning as only one needle hit it. I CANT be too fast otherwise I risk it sliding off an landing on my neighbors floor and i end up truly fucked without a way to get it. Slowly it spins as i pull it up, and it comes through! After SO. God damned long, i have retrieved the empty wrapper of my joint. 

I immediately went inside and took a hit from my bong like i should've done in the first place. Thats what i get for trying to enjoy nature lmao

TL:DR: I wanted to reward myself with a nice joint outside, dropped it into my neighbors plant garden 10 feet below me, and spent almost 2 hours i shouldve been relaxing having a good time before bed McGuyvering different contraptions to retrieve the emptied paper evidence out of there.

"TIFU by not watching the oven and letting muffins bake a little too long
More like yesterday, since that's when this incident happened, but I think the title still stands. Pretty much, my mother blew up at me because I forgot that I was meant to be watching over the oven where she made muffins for lunch and now it feels like she wants nothing to do with me now

As far as the muffins were, they were slightly burnt on the surface, but the inside was well done, very moist and could still be alright for eating

My mother hasn't said that she wants nothing to do with me, but she's been giving me the silent treatment and ignoring me now and because of my living situation and employment, I'm looking into alternatives to make money and moving out sooner rather than later","I accidentally left some muffins in the oven a little bit too long and they only got slightly burnt, and my mother blew up at me over it that she's been ignoring me ever since",My mother blew up at me because I forgot to watch over the oven where she made muffins,I forgot to watch over the oven and now my mother hates me and wants nothing to do with me,TIFU by not watching the oven and letting muffins bake a little too long
"TIFU I think I accidentally flirted with someone’s girlfriend

So I was just vibing at the library last week — headphones on, hoodie up, trying to cram last-minute for a test that I 100% deserved to fail.

Out of nowhere, this girl from the next table (super cute, nose ring, glasses — my weakness) taps me and goes, “Hey, do you have a charger?”

My dumb brain short circuits. I say, “Yeah, but it charges slowly… like my brain.”
Why did I say that?
She laughs. I feel like I just scored a goal in the World Cup.

We chat a bit. Turns out she’s prepping for law school or something smart like that. I'm pretending to understand Latin words I’ve never heard of.

Anyway, I leave thinking, “Damn, maybe this was fate.” I even saved her contact as “Library Crush” like a clown.

Cut to yesterday — I see her walking in the same library again… holding hands with a guy.
And not just holding hands — the ""I-will-hug-you-even-while-walking"" type vibe.

She sees me. Gives me the most awkward smile.
And my dumb brain again whispers: ""Bro… were you the side quest?""

Now I’m sitting here rethinking every interaction:

Was she just being polite?

Was I the free-charger-guy?

Am I in someone’s relationship drama without even kissing anyone?
