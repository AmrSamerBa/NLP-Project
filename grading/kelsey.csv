"TIFU play fighting with my bf, vomiting, then having an asthma attack
Me and my bf were lounging around the house yesterday. We call Sundays ""slack Sundays"" because we both have demanding jobs and Sunday is the only day we really get to chill out and do whatever we want. So we were wrapped up in a sheet on the couch browsing Netflix, no plans, no obligations, snacking on a very healthy and nutritious bowl of candy.

 However, a few hours into our do nothing session, he decided he wanted to do something. He said we should go hiking since the weather is warm, dry, and there was a nice breeze outside. Tbf, we don't get many opportunities to go hiking because of the unpredictable weather here... but the feeling of the cool comfortable sheet burrito. In my comfortable pajamas. Half asleep on the comfortable couch. I was in maximum relaxation mode. In other words, I wasn't about to get up any time soon, and told him. When he tried to persuade me with kisses, I said he would have to fight me out of bed (well, couch.)

This is how it happened. Instead of negotiating like a normal couple when we disagree on things, we like to wrestle, which is what we did. He jumped up and tried to drag me off the couch, while I tried to reel him back in. When he started gaining the upper hand, I decided to make a surprise attack as a last resort and knock him off his feet. So I wrapped my arms around his hips and pulled him down with me. Hard.

.......... I often underestimate our size difference. We're both big, muscular guys; He just has more fat and is 4 inches taller than me. I thought it would be fine as long as I braced myself, and shifted his weight toward the other side of the couch instead of my body.

I was given a very rude reality check.

I was strong enough to tug him down, but definitely not enough to shift his weight. Before he collapsed, he flipped over and ended up landing ass-first on my gut. A couple things happened very quickly: I felt all the wind being knocked out of my lungs and couldn't catch my breath. Then, I started feeling extremely nauseous. All the candy I ate, combined with the jostling from play fighting, and now his butt was grinding into my gut. Awful combination. Before I could shove him off of me, I felt the bile coming up and grabbed the closest vomit receptacle, which was the candy bowl that unfortunately was still half full. And just in time. I've never vomited so much in my life.

Bf immediately wiggled off me and stared at me, understandably shocked. Around the third round of puking, he ran to the kitchen to grab some napkins and I was mostly dry heaving at that point... Which made it difficult to breathe. Then I started wheezing, my airway felt damp, and I could feel my asthma flaring up. I stopped puking just long enough to croak out that I need my inhaler. He thankfully heard me and ran around to the usual places looking for my inhaler, but yelled that he couldn't find it, so he brought my nebulizer and Montelukast pouches instead.

When I finally stopped emptying my stomach, he wiped my mouth and snapped the mask over my face, and I got some some sweet, sweet oxygen back in my lungs. Don't remember much after that because the meds made me feel woozy.

Needless to say; We didn't go hiking, and we're going to be much more careful wrestling from now on.",I pulled my giant boyfriend on top of me while we were play fighting and vomited after his ass jabbed me in the gut.

"TIFU by thinking I still possessed youthful agility
On my run this morning, I came across a saw horse that has been on my route for a little over a week now.   Every other time I’ve gone running, I’ve just run around it. This time, however, I was feeling good and wanted to jump it.  As someone who ran the hurdles in high school, I felt confident that I would be able to do so. 

I was not. Evidently my muscles and tendons are not as springy as they were when I was 18 and I caught my back foot as I was going over it. This caused me to stumble and ultimately face plant into a nearby lamppost. 

Now, I’m sitting here with ice over a golf ball that’s growing over my eye and I have an important work presentation in 24 hours. Not my finest moment.

"TIFU by drinking a smoothie with a coworker
So, this didn't happen today, it happened on Friday, just realized this is right up this subs alley.

So, on Friday, I was decided to hang with a new coworker for the first time after work while our boyfriends were working/busy. We both wanted some food but not something huge so we stopped by a smoothie place. We both got a smoothie with dragon fruit, strawberries, raspberries, mango and mango juice. Everything is going well as we walk the few blocks to his place and get settled in to chat and play some games. I realize I haven't eaten anything in awhile and Im feeling a bit shaky, so I drink a normal amount of gulps from my smoothie, not even a tenth of it, MAYBE 10 gulps. 

I feel it hit my stomach immediately like a rock. I assume it's just my anxiety and/or the caffeine and not eating in awhile, so I just drink some water and chill. Within minutes though, I'm burning up and I feel like I'm going to puke. My anxiety kicks up even more and I ask for a wet paper towel to help me cool off. That does absolutely nothing, and so within another 5 minutes, I'm running to the bathroom and puking up everything I just drank. Afterwards, I can't talk, my throat is absolute raw mess, and I'm realizing that I've bene having increasingly weird reactions to berries over the last 8 months. 

I'm freaking out, my coworker is freaking out, I take a benadryl, call my partner and then end up calling 911 to make sure that I wasn't going into anaphylaxis. They cleared me but now I can't eat any fruits, especially berries until I can get testing done, just in case. I went to the store yesterday and I almost cried because I couldn't get some of my favorite foods for cross contamination concerns. Annnnnd, I managed to have to call 911 on the first time hanging with a new friend.","I drank a smoothie and found out Im allergic, causing me to have to call 911 and now avoid all fruits and berries until further notice.",Drank a smoothie with a new coworker for the first time and felt like I was going to puke.,"Drank a smoothie with berries in it, puked up everything I drank, called 911, now can't eat berries.",TIFU by drinking a smoothie with a coworker for the first time after work while our boyfriends were working/busy.
"TIFU by accidentally trauma-bonding with my boss’s dog and now he follows me home
So my boss brought his dog to the office. Cute golden retriever named Max.  
Everyone was petting him, giving him treats, whatever. I stayed chill. I don’t trust dogs that trust everyone.

Then lunchtime hit. I was having a rough day.  
I sat in the break room alone, eating sad pasta and listening to *Landslide* by Fleetwood Mac.

Max walks in. Looks at me.  
Lays his head on my lap like he knows  
I start talking to him. Not baby talk  like full-on “life’s hard bro, huh?” type beat.  
He *sighs*.

For 20 minutes we just sit there in mutual emotional exhaustion.  
I think I cried a little.

Anyway. Now he follows me around the office. Growls at HR. Tries to get in my car when I leave.  
Today he brought me his leash.

My boss is annoyed.  
His wife says Max sleeps near the door now and “seems distant.”

I think I emotionally hijacked their family dog.

Do I return him? Or is this joint custody now?","Had a sad moment in the break room, boss’s dog comforted me, and now he emotionally imprinted on me.

"TIFU by being way louder than I thought during intimate times
My partner and I are students and still live with our parents. We try to do the deed when no one is at home, but that's not always possible and, well, sometimes the mood strikes with a bad timing. You know how it is, we try to be as quiet as possible, put on some white noise etc. Partner assured me the walls were soundproof and that neither their parents or sister ever mentioned they had heard anything. Well, we happened to have the house to ourselves one day and decide to test it out. Put on some white noise, and one of us moans softly in the room while the other listens from elsewhere in the house.

"TIFU by flushing boiled eggs residue.
20M student and I boil eggs in a kettle. One egg burst inside, and to avoid clogging the sink, I rinsed the kettle and flushed the water into the commode. Later, my roommate went to the bathroom and came back looking awkward. Curious, I checked and saw egg residue had resurfaced it legit looked like someone had j*rked off in there. I panicked, flushed again, and we've never spoken about it since. It’s been pure silence between us ever since the Egg Incident. I still don’t know if he believes the truth or thinks I’m some kind of degenerate. Honestly considering retiring the egg kettle now, but the damage is already done.","Egg exploded in kettle, I flushed it down the toilet, residue made it look like something else happened.

"TIFU by reading a YA novel which is making me rethink my life
(using my burner account just cuz I'm embarrassed and don't want friends to be concerned about me)

Sorry in advance that this isn't the most interesting or crazy thing, but I really want to put this somewhere and I truly feel that I fucked up with this.

I'm a big fan of Dropout, so when I was at the library and saw a graphic novel by Brennan Lee Mulligan, I figured I would give it a read. It was evidently a YA novel. so I didn't think any of themes would be too intense. I was completely wrong.

I read the first two chapters just fine, but then I got to chapter three. It has a plot and a theme that is, far and away, one of my biggest paranoid fears which triggers me every time I see it. I'd describe it here but just thinking about it has me feeling sick and anxious while writing this.

I also made the big mistake of reading this immediately before bed. I was incredibly tired, and when I started sobbing, I couldn't stop. I physically couldn't stop thinking about what happened in the novel, seeing it every time I tried to close my eyes, and my thoughts started racing to all my other anxieties on top of that.

I'm 20, can't drive, live with my parents, don't have a job, and have dealt with suicidal ideation a lot in the past while never telling anybody because I'm scared of being sent away or forced to take pills. Every part of that list and more began swirling through my head, and I had the worst sobbing fit of my entire life so far. Eventually I had to get my parents because I didn't feel safe or like I was a real person.

It's the morning now, and I still can't stop thinking about it. I think I need to make some serious changes to my life, and as I talked about with my mom last night, I'm going to try to talk with my therapist about talking to a psychiatrist and being prescribed anxiety meds. I'm not sure how to feel normal again right now, so I'm going to try talking with my online friends and hopefully find distractions from the uptick in suicidal thoughts (For anyone worrying, I've never actually felt a desire to physically do it, it's just a struggle where I can't stop thinking about it sometimes)",I fucked up by reading a YA graphic novel which triggered me so badly that I'm finally making moves to get on anxiety meds and need to take a few days to distract myself from overwhelming thoughts.,"I read a YA novel which triggers my biggest fears, and I can't stop thinking about it.

"TIFU by getting the most drunk I have ever been in front of my coworkers
My (24F) company had an overnight meeting at a hotel. We had a dinner with an open bar and then an “after party” where the CEO had a tab for us. I was definitely drunk when she and the other higher ups were there, but this i remember and was not doing anything bad. And I was also told I was completely on par with the drunkenness everyone else was. When she left, I remember ordering my own drink (off her tab) and that is it. My coworker said he believes it was really the one that did me in. I woke up in my bed and honestly felt like nothing of note happened. I’ve never blacked out and then stayed awake for 3+ hours. 

I was late to our morning meeting, which was barely noticed. My CEO wished me a safe drive back and everything was fine. Two of my coworkers asked how was i feeling and one made a joke that I got the most sleep out of any of them. On my drive back, a coworker of mine called me how and asked how much i remember. I said after 10? Nothing. I assumed I had just went back and slept. That was NOT the case. I was a wreck. I cried, I talked about family issues, i talked to my ex boyfriend otp in front of them when he called me, called him my boyfriend on the phone, I tried to kiss the coworker that called me on my way home from the meeting multiple times (I am very very lucky he was amused by this. I am a small girl and he is quite a large man that said he would have probably went for it if I wasn’t incoherent. And added the next time k wanna try and kiss him, just be a couple drinks less drunk. But i understand this is at the very least sexual harassment and just because he is not angry doesn’t make it ok. I also have NO idea why i did that? I am not attracted to him in that way, my best guess is talking to my ex made me lonely and I wanted attention? ), I fell many times. Eventually the coworker I tried to kiss got me in my bed and I threw up on my bed, the floor, myself. I was alone when I did this

If you thought “man this couldn’t get any worse” you are WRONG. I then, with vomit on my shirt left my room without my room key and walked to another coworkers room where the people around their late 20s were. (Plus 2 men in their late 30s) I stayed for like 15-20 minutes where everyone could see the vomit on the top 1/5 of my shirt, and then was helped back to my room and called security because I didn’t have a room key. Then housekeeping was called and they cleaned up my room. One of the girls tipped housekeeping (which I asked for her Venmo and immediately sent it to her plus an extra $50 for her trouble). 

I am truly so mortified, I’ve never experienced anything like this. I’ve browned out for hours before, I’ve forgotten how I got home, but I’ve never had a true lapse in memory like this. And the brownouts happened few and far between in college (and were usually planned) ive never not been able to control myself to the point where I threw up somewhere i shouldn’t. Or to the point where I honestly just turned into a completely different person. Or even just to behave in a way that I absolutely am ashamed of. It’s safe to say I will never drink around my coworkers again. I am very socially anxious and I don’t really talk to any one at work. So I think the open bar + anxiety just made me not feel my drinks until it was too late. The coworker that called me was very very kind and they also made it clear to me that everyone in the room immediately agreed to keep it between them and that it was obvious I made a mistake but they would be keeping it between them. That they all have agreed “we’ve all been there”. they were all just worried when I skipped breakfast that I would skip the meeting. And that I should not worry about them spreading it around or telling our boss. And that they all know how horrible I must feel and do not want to add that. From what I can tell, everyone obviously wasn’t pleased (nobody said that but I mean I’m not an idiot) but that they all kind of are choosing to call it a mistake and move on. This is all coming from 2 coworkers but there were I believe 9 total that saw the worst of it. Idk how much I can trust that everyone is just going to forget about it, or If that was just those 2s personal feelings and if everyone else hates me. (When I expressed everyone must hate me, they also said no one hates you or even had a reason to hate you) 

If this happened with people I was close with, I’d feel much better. They know me and know this is unlike me. But these ppl will know me as “that girl”. Bc tbis was the first time in the 2 years I’ve worked there that I’ve ever been in a social setting with them. I’m worried the hotel told my boss or that the company has been banned from the hotel. I keep trying to think myself when I see people in that position and I usually just feel a strong sense of pity and wanting to help. So I am hoping that these people feel the same. I’m not really sure what I’m hoping for people to say, but i have been non stop thinking about this. And any words of comfort or just telling me what to expect or do, or maybe if you think the hotel would have banned the company or informed my boss would be really appreciated.","I got absolutely black out drunk for the first time at an out of state work event.

"TIFU. I explained biology to a friend, possibly ruining her love life.
Basically a while ago I was in an online discussion and the subject of k\*nk came up, and someone mentioned something called ""male squ\*rting."" I was a bit confused, but I wasn't gonna call them out on it. It's online strangers being wrong, I'm not gonna yuck anyone's yum, because who cares, right? but still it was in the back of my mind. Whatever, no biggie.

Today I was talking to a IRL friend, and we were both a little drunk, and we got to the subject of terrible sexual experiences of the past, and I was like ""Okay so here's a weird thing - did you know that there are people who are into something called ""male squ\*rting""? How weird is that?"" And she gets a little embarrassed, and I ask her what's up and she admits to me that her partner is really into that.

Me: ""Oh... okay then"" (clearly uncomfortable)  
Her: ""What? What's wrong?""  
Me: ""No, it's nothing. If you're into it that's great. No judgment.""  
Her: ""Look you clearly got something to say, so go ahead.""  
Me: ""I don't want to, because you might get grossed out and I don't want to ruin anything for you.""  
Her: ""You won't ruin anything, just say it.""  
Me: ""So you know it's just urine, right?""  
Her (clearly horrified): ""What?! No it isn't! Shut up! It's a different thing!""  
Me: ""I mean sure, you get it out differently I suppose, but it's still just urine.""  
Her: ""No it isn't! It's like female squ\*rting!""  
Me: ""you know that's just urine too, right?""  
Her: ""No it isn't! I googled it! Says it's a fluid that contains creatinine and urea""  
Me: ""Okay now google what urine contains.""

She was absolutely horrified and disgusted. Conversation got really really awkward after that, but it turns out her partner basically either lied to her or was unaware of it himself, but he convinced her to let him do it. She said goodbye soon after, and honestly I'm not sure how the hell am I even going to interact with her after this, and how am I supposed to interact with *him*. It just feels so awkward now.","- I explained to my friend that squ\*rting is just urine, and turned out she and her partner were into it, and she wasn't aware of what it was.

"TIFU by trying to get bigger…
Okay so I ain’t the most confident guy in the work when it comes to body image. Penis size.

I heard about penis enlargement and I saw that it’s actually possible to increase length and girth. Okay. I thought “I have to take the first step and start as soon as possible”.

Then I finally took initiative to start the process. Felt proud for managing to search and buy. I got myself a stretcher and a pump online. What I didn’t expect: the sellers would put the fucking label on the package.

The stretcher got here with label “toys… for adult entertainment” (very suggestive in my country). My sister signed it cause I wasn’t at home. Pretty sure she read that label and wondered what I had inside that box.

One week later, today, the pump arrives. My mom  got the package. I don’t think she tends to read labels, to be completely honest, but there is a chance she did, and that one was even worse.

“Automatic pump for penis with LCD penis exten-“ (it cuts, thank god, but not like you can’t find out if you think enough).

I am just that type of guy who’s pretty chill. I felt like my whole life was just exposed. Not sure what I expect posting that shit here but I genuinely wish I could dig a fucking hole and dive deep into it. The seal was almost broke, I could see that someone tried to see through the external package to check what’s inside - no clue if that was the mail guy or my mom, and I honestly don’t know what’s worse.

Pretty sure I’ll be anxious, paranoid and probably (much) more insecure for a while.","bought a pump and a stretcher to increase the size of my pp, but mom and sister probably read the package labels and I feel like dying now 💀",I got a pump and a stretcher for my penis and my mom got it.,Bought a pump for my penis enlargement and the seller put a suggestive label on the package.,"I’m a fucking guy, but I don’t know what to expect."
